Although mature reticulocytes can be efficiently generated by such systems, the numbers produced fall short of that required for therapeutics, due to limited proliferative capacity of the erythroblasts. To overcome this hurdle, approaches are required to increase the expansion potential of such culture systems. The OP9 mouse stromal cell line is known to promote haematopoietic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, however an effect of OP9 cells on erythropoiesis has not been explored. In this study, we show not only OP9 co-culture, but factors secreted by OP9 cells in isolation increase the proliferative potential of adult erythroid cells by delaying differentiation and hence maintaining self-renewing cells for an extended duration. The number of reticulocytes obtained was increased by approximately 3.5-fold, bringing it closer to that required for a therapeutic product. To identify the factors responsible, we analysed the OP9 cell secretome using comparative proteomics, identifying 18 candidate proteins. These data reveal the potential to increase erythroid cell numbers from in vitro culture systems without the need for genetic manipulation or co-culture. © 2018 The Author(s).",,adult; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell count; coculture; differentiation; erythroid cell; erythropoiesis; female; genetic manipulation; male; mouse; nonhuman; OP9 cell line; pluripotent stem cell; proteomics; reticulocyte; stromal cell line,Article

Usually in advanced malignant stages, TGF-β signaling is elevated but global miRNA expression is suppressed. Such a gene expression signature is well illustrated in a fibrosis (or mesenchymal) subtype of ovarian cancer (OC) that is of poor prognosis. However, the interplay between the two pathways in the OC subtype has not yet been elucidated. nc886 is a recently identified non-coding RNA implicated in several malignancies. The high expression of nc886 is associated with poor prognosis in 285 OC patients. Herein, we find that in OC nc886 expression is induced by TGF-β and that nc886 binds to Dicer to inhibit miRNA maturation. By preventing the miRNA pathway, nc886 emulates TGF-β in gene expression patterns and potentiates cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and drug resistance. Here we report nc886 to be a molecular link between the TGF-β and miRNA pathways. © 2018 The Author(s).",,cancer; gene expression; genetic engineering; induced response; RNA,Article

However, actual knowledge regarding the effect of plant-bacteria interactions on enhancing BPA removal is still lacking. In the present study, Dracaena sanderiana endophytic bacteria interactions were investigated to evaluate the effect of bacterial inoculation on BPA removal under hydroponic conditions. Two plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacterial strains, Bacillus thuringiensis and Pantoea dispersa, which have high BPA tolerance and can utilize BPA for growth, were used as plant inocula. P. dispersa-inoculated plants showed the highest BPA removal efficiency at 92.32 ± 1.23% compared to other inoculated and non-inoculated plants. This was due to a higher population of the endophytic inoculum within the plant tissues which resulted in maintained levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) for the plant's physiological needs and lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, B. thuringiensis-inoculated plants had a lower BPA removal efficiency. However, individual B. thuringiensis possessed a significantly higher BPA removal efficiency compared to P. dispersa. This study provides convincing evidence that not all PGP endophytic bacteria-plant interactions could improve the BPA removal efficiency. Different inocula and inoculation times should be investigated before using plant inoculation to enhance phytoremediation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Bacillus thuringiensis; Bisphenol A; Dracaena sanderiana; Endophytic bacteria; Pantoea dispersa,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; indoleacetic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; angiosperm; endocrine disruptor; endophyte; hydroponics; inoculation; phytoremediation; Article; Bacillus thuringiensis; bacterial strain; controlled study; Dracaena; Dracaena sanderiana; endophyte; hydroponics; inoculation; microbial activity; nonhuman; Pantoea; Pantoea dispersa; phytoremediation; plant growth; plant microorganism interaction; plant physiology; plant tissue; waste component removal; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Dracaena sanderiana; Pantoea dispersa",Article

The aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity in genes potentially linked to drug resistance in P. vivax parasites isolated from four different border regions of Thailand; Thai-Myanmar (Tak, Mae Hong Son and Prachuap Khiri Khan Provinces), and Thai-Cambodian borders (Chanthaburi Province). Isolates were collected from 345 P. vivax patients in 2008 and 2014, and parasite DNA extracted and subjected to nucleotide sequencing at five putative drug-resistance loci (Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1, Pvcrt-o and Pvk12). The prevalence of mutations in Pvdhfr, Pvdhps and Pvmdr1 were markedly different between the Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodian border areas and also varied between sampling times. All isolates carried the Pvdhfr (58R and 117N/T) mutation, however, whereas the quadruple mutant allele (I57R58M61T117) was the most prevalent (69.6%) in the Thai-Myanmar border region, the double mutant allele (F57R58T61N117) was at fixation on the Thai-Cambodian border (100%). The most prevalent genotypes of Pvdhps and Pvmdr1 were the double mutant (S382G383K512G553) (65.1%) and single mutant (M958Y976F1076) (46.5%) alleles, respectively on the Thai-Myanmar border while the single Pvdhps mutant (S382G383K512A553) (52.7%) and the triple Pvmdr1 mutant (M958F976L1076) (81%) alleles were dominant on the Thai-Cambodian border. No mutations were observed in the Pvcrt-o gene in either region.

In this study, the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was evaluated for the reliability of model calibration and validation procedures using local-scale data. The model was then employed to evaluate the possible impact of climate change on rice yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in Roi Et Province, Northeast Thailand. The dominant factors that influence the changes in rice yield and SOC sequestration were identified. Four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and Sixteen General Circulation Models under four future time periods; near future (2020–2039), mid future (2040–2059), far future (2060–2079), and very far future (2080–2099) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used as future climate projections. The findings revealed that climate change will impact rice yields positively, which will benefit farmers, especially in rain-fed areas, by +2.6% (RCP8.5: 2080–2099) to +22.7% (RCP6.0: 2080–2099). Rice yields in all case tend to increase significantly by +0.7% (RCP8.5: 2060–2079) to +18.8% (RCP6.0: 2080–2099), with the exception of 2080–2099 under RCP8.5, which results in a decline of rice yield by −8.4%. The precipitation is the most important factor for rice yield in this area. Although rising temperatures will bring a slight rice yield reduction, its impact will be negated by large amounts of increased CO2 concentration and precipitation. Conversely, SOC decreased significantly in all time periods. The highest decreased SOC was a -32.0% decline under RCP8.5 in the very far future. This is because rises in temperature and precipitation, with precipitation being the most important driver, negated the enrichment of CO2 fertilization, resulting in accelerated SOC decomposition rates, which may increase nitrogen availability to the soil and increase yield. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change; EPIC model; Rice; Soil organic carbon; Thailand,agrometeorology; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); crop yield; food security; general circulation model; model validation; soil organic matter; soil quality; Northeastern Region; Roi Et; Thailand,Article

In this study, we report the first polymer-anticancer drug conjugate with poly(glycerol adipate) (PGA) through the successful conjugation of methotrexate (MTX). MTX-PGA conjugates were controllably and simply fabricated by carbodiimide-mediated coupling reaction with various high molar ratios of MTX. The MTX-PGA conjugate self-assembled into nanoparticles with size dependent on the amount of conjugated MTX and the pH of medium. Change in particle size was attributed to steric hindrance and bulkiness inside the nanoparticle core and dissociation of free functional groups of the drug. The MTX-PGA nanoparticles were physically stable in media with pH range of 5–9 and ionic strength of up to 0.15 M NaCl and further chemically stable against hydrolysis in pH 7.4 medium over 30 days but enzymatically degradable to release unchanged free drug. Although 30%MTX-PGA nanoparticles exhibited only slightly less potency than free MTX in 791T cells in contrast to previously reported human serum albumin-MTX conjugates which had >300 times lower potency than free MTX. However, the MTX nanoparticles showed 7 times higher toxicity to Saos-2 cells than MTX. Together with the enzymic degradation experiments, these results suggest that with a suitable biodegradable polymer a linker moiety is not a necessary component. These easily synthesised PGA drug conjugates lacking a linker moiety could therefore be an effective new pathway for development of polymer drug conjugates. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Methotrexate; Nanoparticle; Osteosarcoma cell; Poly(glycerol adipate); Polymer-drug conjugate,Biodegradable polymers; Chemical reactions; Glycerol; Ionic strength; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Sodium chloride; Targeted drug delivery; Adipates; Anti-cancer drug delivery; Enzymic degradation; Human serum albumins; Methotrexate; Methotrexate (MTX); Osteosarcoma cells; Polymer drugs; Controlled drug delivery; cyanamide; human serum albumin; methotrexate; poly(glycerol adipate); polymer; unclassified drug; Article; controlled study; cross coupling reaction; drug conjugation; drug delivery system; drug hydrolysis; drug potency; drug synthesis; human; human cell; ionic strength; nanofabrication; particle size; pH; priority journal; SaOS-2 cell line,Article

Mineral ion loaded HAFS was successfully converted into mHAFS via the hydrothermal heating of HAFS in a SBF (simulated body fluid) solution. The composite mHAFS with PLAChi showed a compressive strength of 20 MPa and a compressive modulus of 539.88 MPa with a microporous structure. In vitro investigation showed that the UMR-106 cells adhered well and proliferated on the mHAFS@PLAChi surface. Most importantly it improved the cell viability and alkaline phosphate (ALP) activity.

This 10-year period study investigated the prevalence of CD in Thailand, and the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Thai CD patients, with special focus on the existence and prevalence of TAFRO syndrome. TAFRO syndrome is defined as CD with thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly. Thirty-three CD patients diagnosed and treated at Siriraj Hospital during January 2007 to December 2016 were included. The prevalence of CD was 1.4 per 1,000,000 patients/10 years. Median age was 46 years, with slight female predominance. Six patients were assigned to the TAFRO group. A high proportion of TAFRO syndrome (18.2%) was found among Thai adult CD patients. In addition to routine TAFRO diagnostic criteria, significantly lower hemoglobin and albumin levels were observed in the TAFRO group than in the non-TAFRO group. Treatment outcomes of CD patients were complete remission (52%), stable disease (30%), and death (13%). Three-year overall survival in the non-TAFRO group and TAFRO group was 88 and 50%, respectively. While most CD patients had a good prognosis, severe cases with TAFRO syndrome had poor outcome. © 2018, The Author(s).",Ascites; Castleman’s disease; Lymphadenopathy; Pleural effusion; TAFRO syndrome,"antineoplastic agent; adult; angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia; ascites; edema; female; fever; follow up; human; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; pleura effusion; prevalence; prognosis; remission; severity of illness index; survival analysis; teaching hospital; Thailand; thrombocytopenia; Adult; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Ascites; Castleman Disease; Edema; Female; Fever; Follow-Up Studies; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Lost to Follow-Up; Male; Middle Aged; Pleural Effusion; Prevalence; Prognosis; Remission Induction; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Thailand; Thrombocytopenia",Article

A pot experiment was carried out by transplanting Napier grass with and without bacterial inoculation in cadmium contaminated soil for 6 months. The results found that Micrococcus sp. significantly promoted the shoot biomass of Napier grass but not the root biomass. Micrococcus sp. and Arthrobacter sp. stimulated cadmium accumulation in the root and the shoot. Cadmium was retained more in the root than the shoot at all plantation periods. The maximum cadmium content in a whole plant was found in plants inoculated with Micrococcus sp. at six months. The values of phytoextraction coefficient and bioaccumulation factor in plants with bacterial inoculation were higher than those in the uninoculated control. Translocation factor was very low. Napier grass could be considered as a candidate plant for cadmium phytostabilization. The calorific value of Napier grass transplanted in cadmium-contaminated soil was similar to that in uncontaminated soil, but cadmium was still retained in the ash and some was emitted into the air. In conclusion, these cadmium-resistant bacteria enhanced the performance of Napier grass on cadmium phytoremediation.

Yet empirical evidence is limited outside of western societies, which have different household structures, work styles, and socio-cultural constructions of the practice. This study examined frequencies of family commensality based on 242 surveys of Japanese adults aged between 20 and 85 in two metropolitan areas. Results showed that family commensality is less frequent not only among those living alone, but also among those living with only non-partners including adult children, parents, and non-family members, than among those living with partners. Full-time employment was associated with late dinner times on weekdays. Later weekday dinner times were strongly associated with reduced frequency of dinners together. Late dinners have become commonplace among full-time workers in postwar Japan, and the peak dinner time in Japan occurs later than in other developed countries. Thus, work and lifestyle constraints impacting schedules appear to influence the frequency of family commensality. Our results suggest that frequencies of family commensality are influenced by co-residents and work styles of participants rather than household sizes. The idea that reduction of household size drives reduction of family commensality may be biased by previous studies conducted in western countries where most people reside in either single or nuclear households. Our study highlights complex determinants of family commensality, beyond presence of other household members, and demonstrates a need for rigorous investigation of family commensality across cultures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,adult; adult child; aged; article; child; developed country; female; full time employment; household; human; human experiment; Japan; Japanese (citizen); lifestyle; major clinical study; male; resident; worker,Article

PLA was presented as a substrate to stimulate production of protease and PLA-degrading enzyme by S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3. The optimal pH values for both protease and PLA-degrading enzyme production by S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. The optimal gelatin concentrations for stimulating protease production in S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 0.3% (w/v), while those for PLA-degrading enzyme production in S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 0.1 and 0.3% (w/v), respectively. In addition, P. geniculata WS3 had a higher percentage of PLA film-weight loss than that of S. pavanii CH1, corresponding with reduced molecular weight of PLA.

Curcuminoid substances has been reported to have benefits in treating dental chronic infection and inflammation diseases, such as chronic periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to find the optimum concentration of Curcuma longa (CL) extract, containing all curcuminoid substances, and the power density of blue light (BL) in photodynamic therapy against periodontally pathogenic bacteria, A. actinomycetemcomitans. Methods: Antibacterial activity of various concentrations of CL extract against A. actinomycetemcomitans was determined. Exponentially growing bacteria were combined with 2-fold dilution of CL extract solution ranging from 25 to 0.098 μg/ml. Co-culture bacteria treated with 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) served as the positive control. The effect of photostimulation with light emitting diode (LED) 420–480 nm at 16.8 J/cm2 for 1 min on the selected concentration of CL extract was examined. Bacteria viability was determined by plate counting technique. In addition, production of free radicals was tested by electron spin resonance spectroscope (ESR) with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). Results: The antibacterial activity of CL extract was dose dependent. Without BL, 25 μg/ml CL extract showed 6.03 ± 0.39 log10 A. actinomycetemcomitans. Interestingly, the combination of BL and 0.78 μg/ml CL extract solution showed complete absence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Peak signal intensity of hydroxyl radical production was also detected with the combination of BL and CL. Conclusions: CL extract not only had antimicrobial activity but also could be used as an effective PS when stimulated with BL in PDT. The optimal antibacterial effect of CL extract with BL was equal to the standard oral disinfectant, 0.12% CHX. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; Curcuma longa extract; Natural photosensitizer; Photodynamic therapy,"5,5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline 1 oxide; chlorhexidine; Curcuma longa extract; hydroxyl radical; Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterial count; bacterial viability; bacterium culture; blue light; coculture; concentration response; controlled study; dilution; electron spin resonance; nonhuman; photodynamic therapy; photostimulation; plate count; priority journal",Article

To address this problem, we here report the first demonstration of an EnFC using a variant of pyranose-2-oxidase (P2O-T169G) which has been shown to have low activity towards oxygen. A simple and biocompatible immobilisation approach incorporating multi-walled-carbon nanotubes within ferrocene (Fc)-Nafion film was implemented to construct EnFCs. Successful immobilisation of the enzymes was demonstrated showing 3.2 and 1.7-fold higher current than when P2O-T169G and GOx were used in solution, respectively. P2O-T169G showed 25% higher power output (maximum power density value of 8.45 ± 1.6 μW cm−2) and better stability than GOx in aerated glucose solutions.

The device was fabricated from a cotton thread (15 cm) treated with indicator solution, providing an easy-to-use platform for rapid measurement of analyte concentration in aqueous solution. The thread was immobilized onto a support, being a polypropylene sheet or box platform, to facilitate loading of liquid samples. Interaction between the deposited reagents and analytes in the samples then occurred within a few minutes. This resulted in zones of color change with different lengths along the thread depending on the analyte concentration. The interaction zones can be analyzed by human eyes based on comparison of the zone lengths with the printed scales which are correlated with the analyte concentrations. Complexometric titration using µTADs was initially investigated for Mg(II) determination in water and rubber latex samples. These devices consisted of two threads which were pretreated with Eriochrome Black T (EBT) and then treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer at pH 10. Both threads were tied together with a central knot before being attached to the box platform prior to the analysis. Load of sample solution (6 µL) resulted in the length of red-violet color product on the threads being proportional to the concentration of Mg(II) in waters and rubber latex samples with the working concentration range of 25–1000 mg L−1. In addition, µTAD with a supporting polypropylene sheet consisting of several threads treated with AgNO3 and K2CrO4 indicators was applied for argentometric titration of chloride ion in water and food seasoning samples. After sample loading (3 µL), the initially red-brown threads turned into white corresponding to formation of AgCl(s) on the threads with a working concentration range of 75–600 mg L−1. Greater selectivity towards Mg(II) and chloride compared with potential interference ions was also observed. All the developed μTADs were applied for analysis of real samples which showed results being in agreement with those obtained by classical titrations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Argentometric titration; Chloride; Complexometric titration; Magnesium (Mg(II)); Microfluidic thread-based analytical device (µTAD),Analytic equipment; Chlorine compounds; Chromium compounds; Color; Colorimetry; Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; Latexes; Microfluidics; Polypropylenes; Potassium compounds; Reinforced plastics; Rubber; Rubber thread; Silver compounds; Solutions; Titration; Volumetric analysis; Analyte concentration; Analytical approach; Chloride; Complexometric titration; Concentration ranges; Eriochrome black T; Polypropylene sheets; Potential interferences; Magnesium compounds,Article

Although most human infection cases are asymptomatic, approximately one in 150 infected individuals develops meningoencephalitis, with a mortality rate of 4–14%. While the development of human neutralizing antibody therapeutics against WNV is strongly anticipated, WNV is difficult to study in conventional laboratories due to its high safety level requirement. In this study, we established fully human WNV-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of inactivated-JEV-vaccinated individuals, and these antibodies exhibited WNV neutralization both in vitro and in vivo.

The pharmacokinetics for LEV in neonatal populations is yet to be clearly understood. In this study, we developed and validated a method for determination of LEV in plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for the purpose of pharmacokinetic study. Methods: Plasma LEV was spiked with Lamivudine as internal standard before extraction by C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. Chromatography was performed using isocratic elution with mobile phase A: B (10: 90) for 2.0 min with flow rate 0.4 mL/min. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% formic acid in 10.0 mM ammonium acetate (A) and 100% methanol (B). The injection volume was 1.0 μL and the total run time was 2.0 min. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with electro spray in positive mode was used. The mass transition for LEV was 171.2/126.0 and 230.0/112.0 for IS with retention time of 0.73 and 0.72 min, respectively. Results: A calibration curve range from 0.50–80.0 μg/mL was obtained with a correlation coefficient >0.99 in the quadratic model. Precision and accuracy was within the acceptable range and the intra- and inter-day %CV for three concentrations of QCs were <10%. Conclusion: This method was reliable, accurate and applicable for LEV pharmacokinetic study in neonates with seizure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Levetiracetam; Liquid chromatography; Neonates; Pharmacokinetics; Tandem mass spectrometry,Extraction; Liquid chromatography; Liquids; Mass spectrometry; Pharmacokinetics; Phase separation; Correlation coefficient; Levetiracetam; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Multiple reaction monitoring; Neonates; Pharmacokinetic studies; Solid phase extraction cartridges; Tandem mass spectrometry; High pressure liquid chromatography,Article

Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, Thailand","It was previously shown that the seasonal H1N1 influenza virus antigenic drift occurred at a slower rate than the seasonal H3N2 virus during the first decade of the 21th century. It was hypothesized that the slower antigenic evolution led to a decrease in average ages of infection, which in turn resulted in lower level of global viral circulation. It is unclear what caused the difference between the two viruses, but a plausible explanation may be related to the fact that the H1N1 virus had been in human population for much longer than the H3N2 virus. This would suggest that H1N1 antigenic drift in an earlier period may have been different from a more recent period. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed seasonal H1N1 influenza sequences during various time periods. In comparison to more recent H1N1 virus, the older H1N1 virus during the first half of the 20th century showed evidences of higher nonsynnonymous/synonymous ration (dN/dS) in its hemagglutinin (HA) gene. We compared amino acid sequence changes in the HA epitopes for each outbreak season and found that there were less changes in later years. Amino acid sequence diversity in the epitopes as measured by sequence entropy became smaller for each passing decade. These suggest that there might be some limit to the antigenic drift. The longer an influenza virus has drifted in human population, the less flexibility it may become. With less flexibility to adapt and escape the host immunity, the virus may have to rely more on younger naïve population. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Antigenic drift; Evolution; H1N1; Influenza virus; Sequence entropy,amino acid; epitope; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; amino acid sequence; Article; entropy; epidemic; evolutionary rate; genetic variability; Influenza A virus (H1N1); nonhuman; priority journal; seasonal influenza,Article

The cyst expansion deteriorates the renal function and, therefore, therapies targeting cyst enlargement are of clinical interest. Of note, inhibition of vasopressin function using vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) antagonist which decreased cAMP production along with AQP2 production and function can slow cyst growth in ADPKD. This finding supports the role of AQP2 in cyst enlargement. Steviol, a major metabolite of the sweetening compound stevioside, was reported to retard MDCK cyst growth and enlargement by inhibiting CFTR activity. Interestingly, its efficacy was found to be higher than that of CFTRinh-172. Since steviol was also found to produce diuresis in rodent, it is likely that steviol might have an additional effect in retarding cyst progression, such as inhibition of AQP2 expression and function. Here, we investigated the effect of steviol on AQP2 function and on cyst growth using an in vitro cyst model (MDCK and Pkd1−/− cells). We found that steviol could markedly inhibit cyst growth by reducing AQP2 expression in both Pkd1−/− and MDCK cells. Real-time PCR also revealed that steviol decreased AQP2 mRNA expression level as well. Moreover, a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, and the lysosomotropic agent, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to abolish the inhibitory effect of steviol in Pkd1−/− cells. Increased lysosomal enzyme marker (LAMP2) expression following steviol treatment clearly confirmed the involvement of lysosomes in steviol action. In conclusion, our finding showed for the first time that steviol slowed cyst growth, in part, by reducing AQP2 transcription, promoted proteasome, and lysosome-mediated AQP2 degradation. Due to its multiple actions, steviol is a promising compound for further development in the treatment of PKD. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Aquaporin 2; Lysosome; Proteasome; Renal cyst growth; Steviol,aquaporin 2; benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; cyclic AMP; cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; hydroxychloroquine; lysosome associated membrane protein 2; messenger RNA; proteasome; steviol; animal cell; Article; controlled study; diuresis; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; gene expression; in vitro study; kidney cyst; kidney polycystic disease; lysosome; MDCK cell line; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA transcription,Article

Many patients with diabetic retinopathy lose their vision because of the late detection of the disease. Thus, this paper is to propose a novel method of hard exudates segmentation in retinal images in an automatic way. (Methods): The existing methods are based on either supervised or unsupervised learning techniques. In addition, the learned segmentation models may often cause miss-detection and/or fault-detection of hard exudates, due to the lack of rich characteristics, the intra-variations, and the similarity with other components in the retinal image. Thus, in this paper, the supervised learning based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is only used to identify initial seeds with high confidences to be hard exudates. Then, the segmentation is finalized by unsupervised learning based on the iterative graph cut (GC) using clusters of initial seeds. Also, in order to reduce color intra-variations of hard exudates in different retinal images, the color transfer (CT) is applied to normalize their color information, in the pre-processing step. (Results): The experiments and comparisons with the other existing methods are based on the two well-known datasets, e_ophtha EX and DIARETDB1. It can be seen that the proposed method outperforms the other existing methods in the literature, with the sensitivity in the pixel-level of 0.891 for the DIARETDB1 dataset and 0.564 for the e_ophtha EX dataset. The cross datasets validation where the training process is performed on one dataset and the testing process is performed on another dataset is also evaluated in this paper, in order to illustrate the robustness of the proposed method. (Conclusions): This newly proposed method integrates the supervised learning and unsupervised learning based techniques. It achieves the improved performance, when compared with the existing methods in the literature.

A total of 39,050 cultures yielded 1,341 target pathogens. Resistance rates were high; 82% each of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were multidrug resistant. Hospital-acquired isolates were more often resistant than community-acquired isolates; resistance trends over time were heterogeneous. K. pneumoniae isolates from neonates were more likely than those from nonneonates to be resistant to ampicillin-gentamicin and third-generation cephalosporins. In patients with community-acquired gram-negative bacteremia, third-generation cephalosporin resistance was associated with increased mortality rates, increased intensive care unit admissions, and 2.26-fold increased healthcare costs among survivors.

The SCB was pretreated by hydrothermal pretreatment using five different types of solid acid catalysts (SACs): (1) self-synthesis SiO2–OSO3H, (2) SO4 2−/TiO2/Fe3O4/WO3, (3) sulfonated bentonite and commercial SAC, (4) Amberlyst® 15, and (5) Dowex® 50WX8. Fractionation of SCB was conducted in a combination with choline acetate (ChOAc) ionic liquid (IL) at moderate temperature. After enzyme hydrolysis, the highest total reducing sugar (TRS) yield of 78.1% was achieved when pretreated with SiO2–OSO3H. For the black liquor from fractionation, the highest amount of lignin could be precipitated from ChOAc IL through treatment with SO4 2−/TiO2/Fe3O4/WO3. Pyrolysis of dry precipitated lignin was performed at 400 and 500 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, and phenolic-rich oil was produced. Carbon microspheres appeared in the solid phase from the pyrolysis. It was postulated that lignin was first degraded to phenol with an aromatic structure, while other sugar residues (C5 and C6) in the lignin molecule formed ring compounds. These compounds underwent condensation polymerization as a shell-like shape, and carbon rich microspheres were thus formed. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Bio-oil; Carbon microspheres; Hydrothermal; Ionic liquid; Pyrolysis; Solid acid catalyst; Sugarcane bagasse,Bagasse; Biofuels; Catalysts; Condensation reactions; Hydrothermal synthesis; Ionic liquids; Lignin; Polycondensation; Pyrolysis; Silica; Bio oil; Carbon microspheres; Hydrothermal; Solid acid catalysts; Sugar-cane bagasse; Microspheres,Article

An andrographolide analogue, 3A.1 (19-tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-8, 17-epoxy andrographolide) has previously been reported to be potently cytotoxic toward cancer cells by unknown molecular mechanisms. The present study explored the anti-cancer activity of analogue 3A.1 on Wnt/β-catenin signaling in colon cancer cells (HT29 cells) which were more sensitive to the others (HCT116 and SW480 cells). Analogue 3A.1 inhibited viability of HT29 cells with IC50 value of 11.1 ± 1.4 μM at 24 h, which was more potent than that of the parent andrographolide. Analogue 3A.1 also suppressed the proliferation of HT29 cells and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Its apoptotic activity was accompanied with increased expressions of proteins related to DNA damages; PARP-1 and γ-H2AX. In addition, analogue 3A.1 significantly inhibited T-cell factor and lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) promoter activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Accordingly, the expressions of Wnt target genes and β-catenin protein were suppressed. Moreover, analogue 3A.1 increased the activity of GSK-3β kinase, which is a negative regulator responsible for degradation of intracellular β-catenin. This mode of action was further supported by the absence of the effects after treatment with a GSK-3β inhibitor, and over-expression of a mutant β-catenin (S33Y). Our findings reveal, for the first time, an insight into the molecular mechanism of the anti-cancer activity of analogue 3A.1 through the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin/GSK-3β pathway and provide a therapeutic potential of the andrographolide analogue 3A.1 in CRC treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Andrographolide analogue; Anti-cancer; Colorectal cancer; GSK-3β; Wnt/β-catenin,"3a.1 (19 tert butyldiphenylsilyl 8, 17 epoxy andrographolide); andrographolide; antineoplastic agent; beta catenin; cyclin D1; doxorubicin; histone H2AX; matrilysin; Myc protein; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; survivin; T cell factor protein; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; cell viability; colorectal cancer; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA damage; dose response; drug mechanism; gene expression; HCT 116 cell line; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; SW480 cell line; Wnt signaling",Article

CA16 infections are usually mild, while EV71 disease may be fatal due to neurologic complications. As such, the ability to rapidly and specifically recognize EV71 is needed to facilitate proper case management and epidemic control. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to generate antibodies to EV71-virion protein-2 (VP2) by phage display technology for further use in specific detection of EV71. A recombinant peptide sequence of EV71-VP2, carrying a predicted conserved B cell epitope fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (designated GST-EV71-VP2/131-160), was produced. The fusion protein was used as bait in in-solution biopanning to separate protein-bound phages from a murine scFv (MuscFv) phage display library constructed from an immunoglobulin gene repertoire from naïve ICR mice. Three phage-transformed E. coli clones (clones 63, 82, and 83) produced MuscFvs that bound to the GST-EV71-VP2/131-160 peptide. The MuscFv of clone 83 (MuscFv83), which produced the highest ELISA signal to the target antigen, was further tested. MuscFv83 also bound to full-length EV71-VP2 and EV71 particles, but did not bind to GST, full-length EV71-VP1, or the antigenically related CA16. MuscFv83 could be a suitable reagent for rapid antigen-based immunoassay, such as immunochromatography (ICT), for the specific detection and/or diagnosis of EV71 infection as well as epidemic surveillance. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"capsid protein; epitope; hybrid protein; neutralizing antibody; single chain fragment variable antibody; virus antibody; animal; biosynthesis; Enterovirus A; Enterovirus infection; Escherichia coli; genetics; hand foot and mouth disease; human; immunology; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; mouse; peptide library; virology; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Capsid Proteins; Enterovirus A, Human; Enterovirus Infections; Epitopes; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Escherichia coli; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Peptide Library; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Single-Chain Antibodies",Article

The positive predictive values were high in universal and swine- and cattle-specific markers (85–100%), while the positive predictive value of the human-specific assay was 52.2%. The negative predictive values in all assays were relatively high (90.8–100%). A suite of PCR assays in Thailand was established for potential MST use in environmental waters, which supports the worldwide applicability of Bacteroidales gene markers. This study also emphasizes the importance of using a proper sample size in assessing the performance of MST markers in a new geographic region. The successful validation of the Bacteroidales fecal markers for MST with fecal samples in Southeast Asia strongly supports their global use, with an emphasis on significant sample size calculation as a vital approach for evaluating MST markers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Bacteroidales; Microbial source tracking; PCR; Southeast Asia; Tropical watershed,Animals; Assays; Developing countries; Genes; Sampling; Sewage; Statistical tests; Water pollution; Watersheds; Agricultural watersheds; Bacteroidales; Confidence interval; Microbial source tracking; Negative predictive value; Positive predictive values; Southeast Asia; Stratified random sampling; Polymerase chain reaction; article; Bacteroidales; calculation; chin; diagnostic test accuracy study; farm animal; human; human tissue; limit of detection; major clinical study; marker gene; nonhuman; pig; plasmid; predictive value; prevalence; real time polymerase chain reaction; sample size; sewage; Thailand; validation process; watershed; Animalia; Bacteroidales; Bos; Suidae,Article

Evidently, brain insulin signaling contributes to physiological effects, including energy homeostasis, and learning and memory. Arsenic has been shown to impair insulin signaling in adipocytes and myocytes, however, this impairment has not yet been explored in neurons. Here we showed that NaAsO2 caused significant reduction in basal levels of glucose, plasma membrane glucose transporter, GLUT 3 and Akt phosphorylation in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. NaAsO2 significantly decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake, as well as GLUT1 and 3 membrane translocation. Furthermore, the ability of insulin to increase Akt phosphorylation, a well-recognized insulin signaling response, was significantly lessened by NaAsO2 treatment. In addition, the classical tyrosine phosphorylation response of insulin was reduced by NaAsO2, as evidenced by reduction of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1(IRS-1). Moreover, NaAsO2 lowered the ratio of p110, a catalytic subunit to p85, a regulatory subunit of PI3K causing an imbalance between p110 and p85, the conditions reported to contribute to insulin sensitivity. Additionally, increment of IRS-1 interaction with GSK3β, and p85-PI3K were observed in NaAsO2 treated cells. These molecular modulations may be mechanistically attributed to neuronal insulin signaling impairment by arsenic. © 2018",Akt; Arsenic; Insulin; Insulin receptor (IR); Insulin receptor substrate (IRS); PI3K,arsenic; glucose; glucose transporter; glucose transporter 1; glucose transporter 3; glycogen synthase kinase 3; insulin receptor; insulin receptor substrate 1; protein kinase B; Article; cell differentiation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; cytotoxicity test; enzyme phosphorylation; glucose transport; human; human cell; insulin signaling; priority journal; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein transport; quantitative analysis; SH-SY5Y cell line,Article

In this study, we enlarged sample size and developed a technique for identifying brain tissue in aged samples. Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis—for EML2 (COBRA-EML2) technique was established and validated in various organ samples obtained from 108 autopsies. In addition, this technique was also tested for its reliability, minimal DNA concentration detected, and use in aged samples and in samples obtained from specific brain compartments and spinal cord. COBRA-EML2 displayed 100% sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing brain tissue from other tissues, showed high reliability, was capable of detecting minimal DNA concentration (0.015 ng/μl), could be used for identifying brain tissue in aged samples. In summary, COBRA-EML2 is a technique to identify brain tissue. This analysis is useful in criminal cases since it can identify the vital organ tissues from small samples acquired from criminal scenes. The results from this analysis can be counted as a medical and forensic marker supporting criminal investigations, and as one of the evidences in court rulings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",COBRA-EML2; DNA methylation; EML2; Site-specific methylation,bisulfite; DNA; age; Article; autopsy; brain tissue; combined bisulfite restriction analysis EML2; controlled study; diagnostic test; DNA determination; EML2 gene; forensic medicine; gene; genetic procedures; human; human tissue; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity,Article

Methods Data from 87 patients with cervical cancer recruited from a referral hospital in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia, from an earlier study of health-related quality of life were used in this study. The differences among the utility scores derived from the four value sets were determined using the Friedman test. Performance of the psychometric properties of the four value sets versus visual analogue scale (VAS) was assessed. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used to test the agreement among the utility scores. Spearman ρ correlation coefficients were used to assess convergent validity between utility scores and patients’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. With respect to known-group validity, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine the differences in utility according to the stages of cancer. Results There was significant difference among utility scores derived from the four value sets, among which the Malaysian value set yielded higher utility than the other three value sets. Utility obtained from the Malaysian value set had more agreements with VAS than the other value sets versus VAS (intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plot tests results). As for the validity, the four value sets showed equivalent psychometric properties as those that resulted from convergent and known-group validity tests. Conclusions In the absence of an Indonesian value set, the Malaysian value set was more preferable to be used compared with the other value sets. Further studies on the development of an Indonesian value set need to be conducted. © 2017",cervical cancer patients; EQ-5D; Indonesia; utility; value sets comparison,adult; Article; Bland Altman plot; cancer patient; cancer staging; comparative study; controlled study; convergent validity; correlation coefficient; demography; EuroQol five dimensional three level index score; female; Friedman test; human; Indonesia; Kruskal Wallis test; major clinical study; Malaysia; Malaysian; priority journal; psychometry; quality of life; quality of life assessment; scoring system; Singapore; Singaporean; statistical parameters; Thailand; United Kingdom; uterine cervix cancer; value set; visual analog scale,Article

Functional studies using RNA interference have suggested that PmHHAP is involved in hemocyte homeostasis by controlling apoptosis during WSSV infection. In this study, the role of PmHHAP in host–viral interactions was further investigated. Yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that PmHHAP binds to an anti-apoptosis protein, WSSV134. The viral protein WSSV134 is a late protein of WSSV, expressed 24 h post infection (hpi). Gene silencing of WSSV134 in WSSV-infected shrimp resulted in a reduction of the expression level of the viral replication marker genes VP28, wsv477, and ie-1, which suggests that WSSV134 is likely involved in viral propagation. However, co-silencing of PmHHAP and WSSV134 counteracted the effects on WSSV infection, which implies the importance of the host–pathogen interaction between PmHHAP and WSSV134 in WSSV infection. In addition, caspase 3/7 activity was noticeably induced in the PmHHAP and WSSV134 co-silenced shrimp upon WSSV infection. Moreover, PmHHAP and WSSV134 inhibited caspase-induced activation of PmCasp in vitro in a non-competitive manner. Taken together, these results suggest that PmHHAP and WSSV134 play a role in the host–pathogen interaction and work concordantly to control apoptosis in WSSV infection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Apoptosis; Caspase; Hemocyte homeostasis-associated protein; Shrimp immunity; White spot syndrome virus,double stranded RNA; hemocyte homeostasis associated protein; unclassified drug; viral protein; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; blood cell; competitive inhibition; DNA template; enzyme activation; gene knockdown; gene silencing; genetic screening; host pathogen interaction; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; nonhuman; Penaeus monodon; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; promoter region; protein analysis; protein protein interaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA interference; upregulation; virus gene; virus replication; White spot syndrome virus,Article

Eligible were 955 patients with AA, treated first line with Thymoglobulin, between 2001 and 2008 (n = 492), or between 2009 and 2012 (n = 463). The median age of the patients was 21 years (range 1-84). Mortality within 90 days was 5.7% and 2.4%, respectively in the two time periods (P =.007).The actuarial 10-year survival for the entire population was 70%; transplant free survival was 64%. Predictors of survival in multivariate analysis, were severity of the disease, patients age and the interval between diagnosis and treatment. Survival was 87% vs 61% for responders at 6 months versus nonresponders (P <.0001). The 10-year survival of nonresponders at 6 months, undergoing a subsequent transplant (n = 110), was 64%, vs 60% for patient not transplantated (n = 266) (P =.1). The cumulative incidence of response was 37%, 52%, 65% respectively, at 90, 180, and 365 days. In multivariate analysis, negative predictors of response at 6 months, were older age, longer interval diagnosis treatment, and greater severity of the disease. In conclusion, early mortality is low after first line treatment of AA with Thymoglobulin, and has been further reduced after year 2008. Patients age, together with interval diagnosis—treament and severity of the disease, remain strong predictors of response and survival. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,cyclosporine; thymocyte antibody; adult; age; aged; aplastic anemia; Article; Asia; cancer survival; cause of death; child; controlled study; delayed diagnosis; disease severity; Europe; female; human; human cell; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; prediction; preschool child; priority journal; retrospective study; school child; therapy delay; transplant free survival; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult,Article

Our objective was to establish standard outcome measures for postoperative pulmonary complications research. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, Web of Science, SciELO, and the Korean Journal Database. Definitions were extracted from included manuscripts. We then conducted a three-stage Delphi consensus process to select the optimal outcome measures in terms of methodological quality and overall suitability for perioperative trials. Results: From 2358 records, the full texts of 81 manuscripts were retrieved, of which 45 met the inclusion criteria. We identified three main categories of outcome measure specific to perioperative pulmonary outcomes: (i) composite outcome measures of multiple pulmonary outcomes (27 definitions); (ii) pneumonia (12 definitions); and (iii) respiratory failure (six definitions). These were rated by the group according to suitability for routine use. The majority of definitions were given a low score, and many were imprecise, difficult to apply consistently, or both, in large patient populations. A small number of highly rated definitions were identified as appropriate for widespread use. The group then recommended four outcome measures for future use, including one new definition. Conclusions: A large number of postoperative pulmonary outcome measures have been used, but most are poorly defined.

However, its application is limited by short-term effectiveness and requirement of lifelong periodic administration of SSO, especially for chronic diseases like thalassemias. Here, we engineered lentiviral vectors that stably express U7 small nuclear RNA (U7 snRNA) carrying the splice-switching sequence of the SSO that restores correct splicing of βE-globin pre-mRNA and achieves a long-term therapeutic effect. Using a two-step tiling approach, we systematically screened U7 snRNAs carrying splice-switching SSO sequences targeted to the cryptic 5′ splice site created by HbE mutation. We tested this approach and identified the most responsive element for mediating splicing correction in engineered U7 snRNAs in HeLa-βE cell model cell line. Remarkably, the U7 snRNA lentiviral vector (U7 βE4+1) targeted to this region effectively restored the correctly-spliced βE-globin mRNA for at least 5 months. Moreover, the effects of the U7 βE4+1 snRNA lentiviral vector were also evident as upregulation of the correctly-spliced βE-globin mRNA in erythroid progenitor cells from β-thalassemia/HbE patients treated with the vector, which led to improvements of pathologies in erythroid progenitor cells from thalassemia patients. These results suggest that the splicing correction of βE-globin pre-mRNA by the engineered U7 snRNA lentiviral vector provides a promising, long-term treatment for β-thalassemia/HbE. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Gene therapy; HbE; RNA splicing; Thalassemia; U7 snRNA,"hemoglobin E; lentivirus vector; messenger RNA; small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; small nuclear RNA; hemoglobin beta chain; hemoglobin E; RNA precursor; small nuclear RNA; U7 small nuclear RNA; Article; controlled study; erythroid cell; erythroid precursor cell; gene expression; genetic engineering; hemoglobin E-beta thalassemia; human; human cell; mutation; priority journal; protein expression; RNA sequence; RNA splice site; RNA splicing; upregulation; viral gene therapy; beta thalassemia; chemistry; exon; gene therapy; gene vector; genetic engineering; genetics; HeLa cell line; Lentivirus; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; pathology; primary cell culture; procedures; Base Sequence; beta-Globins; beta-Thalassemia; Erythroid Precursor Cells; Exons; Genetic Engineering; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; HeLa Cells; Hemoglobin E; Humans; Lentivirus; Mutation; Primary Cell Culture; RNA Precursors; RNA Splice Sites; RNA Splicing; RNA, Small Nuclear",Article

In this study, a subset of bacterial strains from children was isolated and evaluated for beneficial probiotic traits such as antimicrobial activity, bile and acid tolerance, and pathogenic cell adherence inhibition. The strain with the best antimicrobial activity was selected for further characterization on the basis of morphological, biochemical characteristics and gene sequence. This strain was Gram-positive, oxidase and catalase-negative, and it produced acids by fermenting sugar and starch as carbon sources. Additionally, it could only hydrolyze bile-esculin, but not red blood cells. The 16S rDNA gene sequence revealed that this strain was Enterococcus faecalis. Interestingly, this strain effectively inhibited a variety of pathogens by acid and bacteriocin production and was bile-tolerant, able to survive under acidic condition. In the safety assessments, E. faecalis MTC 1032 could adhere to host epithelial cells and evidently inhibited pathogenic cell adhesion as demonstrated by cell reduction over time of E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. typhimurium ATCC 13311 on Caco-2 cell line.

Aim of the study: With this study we firstly aim to document the practice of cancer treatment and prevention by TTM practitioners and, secondly, to evaluate how such traditional concepts and practices are correlated with biomedical ones. This in turn can form the basis for developing novel strategies for designing pharmacological experiments and longer term strategies to develop TTM practice. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 33 TTM practitioners were performed in five provinces in different regions of Thailand. The following information were recorded; basic information of informants, descriptions of cancer (mareng in Thai), causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Plants used in the treatment and prevention of mareng were also collected. Results: Using an in depth ethnographic approach four representative case studies to assist in a better understanding of the characteristics of mareng, its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are reported here. Five characteristics of mareng – waste accumulation (khong sia), chronic illnesses (krasai), inflammation (kan aksep), bad blood (luead) and lymph (namlueang), and the imbalance of four basic elements (dhātu si) – have been identified. Explanatory models of cancer in TTM were linked with biomedical concepts and relevant pharmacological actions. Traditional uses and available scientific evidence of medicinal plants mentioned in the case studies for the treatment or prevention of mareng are presented and discussed. Conclusion: Here for the first time five main characteristics of cancer based on Thai traditional medical concepts are analysed. Our findings are relevant not only for the planning of clinical studies or pharmacological experiment in the search for novel compounds for cancer treatment and prevention, but also for the integration of Thai traditional medicine in cancer care. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cancer; Integrative medicine; Mareng; Thai traditional medicine; Traditional medicine,herbaceous agent; anthropology; Article; bioaccumulation; cancer diagnosis; cancer prevention; cancer therapy; chronic disease; circulation; clinical evaluation; clinical practice; Dangdeed; Emblica officinalis; ethnopharmacology; Horathaosunak; Huayang; human; inflammation; Kasalong; Khanthongpha yabat; Khanunsampalo; Khaoyennuea; Khaoyentai; Khokhlan; lymph node; Makhampom; malignant neoplasm; medicinal plant; mung bean; Nontaiyak; Oidam; Peeb; Phakdeed; Phakkhaotong; Phakwanban; Phlukhao; Rangchued; semi structured interview; Terminalia bellirica; Thailand; Thaowanpriang; Thuakheaw; traditional medicine; Triphala; Yadokkhao; Yamornoi; Yapakkhwai,Article

Efficient loading of BDP inside the HNT lumen was demonstrated. Qualitative and quantitative characterization of BDP-loaded HNT revealed that BDP was mainly encapsulated inside the central lumen of halloysite and also located in the small pores on the outer surface of HNT. The use of only BDP (up to 4 wt%) or HNT (up to 10 wt%) cannot improve the UL-94 of the PA6 to reach V-0 classification. By combining use of HNT and BDP, the nanocomposites achieved V-0 rating with significant suppression in peak heat release rate and total heat release from cone calorimeter. The negative effect of BDP on strength and rigidity of PA6 composites was obviously minimized by encapsulating some portions of BDP in the nanotube. As a result, the tensile strength and thermal stability of the PA6 retained without loss of stiffness. During burning process, the BDP in the bulk polymer performed its function in the early period of the process, whereas the BDP inside the nanotube possessed a prolonged release for flame retardation at the later stage of combustion. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,Flame retardants; Kaolinite; Mechanical properties; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Tensile strength; Thermodynamic stability; Yarn; Cone calorimeter; Flame retardancy; Flame retardation; Halloysite nanotubes; Peak heat release rates; Prolonged release; Quantitative characterization; Total heat release; Combustion,Article

After previously establishing that lentiviral transfer of a marked β-globin (βA-T87Q) gene could substitute for long-term red-cell transfusions in a patien with β-thalassemia, we wanted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of such gene therapy in patients with transfusiondependent β-thalassemia. METHODS: In two phase 1-2 studies, we obtained mobilized autologos CD34+ cells from 22 patients (12 to 35 years of age) with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and transduced the cells ex vivo with LentiGlobin BB305 vector, which encodes adult hemoglobin (HbA) with a T87Q amino acid substitution (HbAT87Q). The cells were then reinfused after the patients had undergone myeloablative busulfan conditioning. We subsequently monitored adverse events, vector integration, and levels of replicatin-competent lentivirus. Efficacy assessments included levels of total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q, transfusion requirements, and average vector copy number. RESULTS: At a median of 26 months (range, 15 to 42) after infusion of the gene-modified cells, all but 1 of the 13 patients who had a non-β0/β0 genotype had stopped receiving red-cell transfusions; the levels of HbAT87Q ranged from 3.4 to 10.0 g per deciliter, and the levels of total hemoglobin ranged from 8.2 to 13.7 g per deciliter. Correction of biologic markers of dyserythropoiesis was achieved in evaluated patients with hemoglobin levels near normal ranges. In 9 patients with a β0/β genotype or two copies of the IVS1-110 mutation, the median annualized transfusion volume was decreased by 73%, and red-cell transfusions were discontinued in 3 patients. Treatment-related adverse events were typical of those associated with autologous stem-cell transplantation. No clonal dominance related to vector integration was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Gene therapy with autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BB305 vector reduced or eliminated the need for long-term red-cell transfusions in 22 patients with severe β-thalassemia witout serious adverse events related to the drug product.

The rhodol levulinate probe (RL) demonstrated high selectivity and sensitivity toward hydrazine among other molecules. The chromogenic response of RL solution to hydrazine from colorless to pink could be readily observed by the naked eye, while strong fluorescence emission could be monitored upon excitation at 525 nm. The detection process occurred via a ring-opening process of the spirolactone initiated by hydrazinolysis, triggering the fluorescence emission with a 53-fold enhancement. The probe rapidly reacted with hydrazine in aqueous medium with the detection limit of 26 nM (0.83 ppb), lower than the threshold limit value (TLV) of 10 ppb suggested by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, RL-impregnated paper strips could detect hydrazine vapor. For biological applicability of RL, its membrane-permeable property led to bioimaging of hydrazine in live HepG2 cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bioimaging; Fluorescent detection; Hydrazine-selective chemosensor; Levulinate; Rhodol,Environmental Protection Agency; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Negative ions; Nitrogen compounds; Physiology; Probes; Bio-imaging; Chemosensor; Fluorescent detection; Levulinate; Rhodol; Hydrazine,Article

However, the solid state reaction of effective catalyst and starch molecules requires specific interaction between active sites in catalyst and α,1-4 glycosidic bonds in starch. Therefore, in this study catalyst mixed-milling was conducted prior to thermal hydrolysis to enhance glucose production efficiency. The results showed that catalyst mixed-milling process (24 h) followed by thermo-hydrolysis at 140 °C for 6 h using HA-L-SO3H gave highest starch conversion of 93.72% corresponding to 37.45% glucose yield and 83% selectivity. From the kinetic study, the rate constant of cassava mash-to-oligomers conversion (k1) using catalyst mixed-milling was 1.77 times higher than ball-milling without adding catalyst. This indicated that mixed-milling solid state reaction with effective catalyst significantly provided complete cassava mash conversion and enhanced selectivity as well as rate of starch depolymerization reaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Ball-milling; Carbonaceous solid acid catalyst; Cassava mash; Mixed-milling; Starch thermo-hydrolysis,Ball milling; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Glucose; Hydrolysis; Milling (machining); Plants (botany); Rate constants; Solid state reactions; Starch; Cassava mashes; Glucose production; Glycosidic bond; Solid acid catalysts; Specific interaction; Starch depolymerization; Starch molecules; Thermal hydrolysis; Catalyst activity; catalyst; chemical bonding; chemical reaction; crop residue; energy efficiency; glucose; hydrolysis; milling; reaction kinetics; solid; starch; Manihot esculenta,Article

The physicochemical properties of Mag-H were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), texture analyzer, swelling test, and in vitro drug release behavior using methylene blue (MB) as a model drug. The FTIR spectra showed that glutaraldehyde crosslinked with gelatin. To improve the thermal and mechanical properties of gelatin hydrogel (Gel-H), the BC and magnetic nanoparticles were incorporated into the gelatin network. Due to the superparamagnetism of magnetic nanoparticles, Mag-H possessed a powerful magnetic property for achieving a magnetic targeting. Mag-H had a maximum swelling ratio of 1085 ± 12% in phosphate buffer saline (pH 1.2) at 37 °C, meanwhile its maximum drug release of 80.77 ± 0.33% was observed at the same condition with an external magnetic field application.

Clinically significant Rh blood group system antigens, including D, C, E, c, and e, can be simultaneously identified via solid phase immobilization assay, which offers significant time savings and assay simplification. Red blood cells (RBCs) flowed through the micro-channel, where a suitable condition for Rh blood group detection was an RBC dilution of 1:10 with a stop-flow condition. Stop flow showed an improvement in specific binding compared to continuous flow. Rh antigens required a longer incubation time to react with the immobilized antibody than A and B antigens due to the difference in antigen type and their location on the RBC. The interaction between the immobilized antibodies and their specific antigenic counterpart on the RBC showed a significant difference in RBC removal behavior using shear flow, measured from the decay of the SPR signal. The strength of the interaction between the immobilized antibody and RBC antigen was determined from the minimum wall shear stress required to start the decay process in the SPR signal. For a given range of immobilized antibody surface densities, the Rh antigen possesses a stronger interaction than A, B, and AB antigens. Identification of 82 samples of ABO and Rh blood groups using SPRi showed good agreement with the standard micro-column agglutination technique. A wider coverage of antigenic recognition for RBC when using the solid phase immobilization assay was demonstrated for the RBC with the antigenic site located on the transmembrane protein of the clinically significant Rh antigen. Given the level of accuracy and precision, the technique showed potential for the detection of the Rh minor blood group system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Blood; Blood grouping; Microarray; Rh blood group; SPR imaging,Antibodies; Antigen-antibody reactions; Antigens; Bioassay; Blood; Microarrays; Plasmons; Rhodium; Shear flow; Shear stress; Accuracy and precision; Blood group; Immobilized antibodies; SPR imaging; Suitable conditions; Surface plasmon resonance imaging; Trans-membrane proteins; Wall shear stress; Surface plasmon resonance; blood group A antigen; blood group B antigen; blood group E antigen; membrane protein; rhesus AB antigen; rhesus antigen; rhesus C antibody; rhesus C antigen; rhesus D antibody; rhesus D antigen; rhesus E antibody; unclassified drug; agglutination test; antigen detection; antigen recognition; Article; blood group rhesus system; blood sampling; cell adhesion; concentration (parameters); controlled study; erythrocyte; hematocrit; immobilization; incubation time; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; shear stress; surface plasmon resonance,Article

The objectives of this study are to investigate crop-residue management and estimate the amount of pollutant emissions from burning crop residues for each land-use pattern (grain maize, seed maize and integrated farming), and to estimate the chemical compositions of PM2.5 emissions from agricultural burning in Mae Chaem basin, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. The purposive sampling method was used for sample selection. A door-to-door questionnaire survey was used to obtain responses from 149 respondents. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the open burning of crop residues were estimated, using specific emission factors obtained from several literature reviews and from the field by the questionnaire survey. Results revealed that the majority of farmers burned maize residues during April and May and mostly in the afternoon. These burning behaviors are in line with the supportive weather conditions that reflect high values of temperature and wind speed, and less rainfall and relative humidity result in maize residues being burned easily and quickly. The integrated farming system generated the lowest GHG emissions and amount of chemical composition of PM2.5 emissions, followed by the grain maize and seed maize patterns, respectively. This study strongly supports the implementation of the integrated farming system in Mae Chaem basin. Proactive and reactive measures should be taken in a well-organized and systematic fashion and should engage all related parties.

Scholars have also shown that ‘Third World’ tourism fuelled by media fantasies of the Other represents neo-colonization in the twenty-first century. However, considering all its intentions/claims of impartiality, tourism research has generally travelled in only one direction (from the West to the East). In this study, conducted in Goa and Puducherry, focusing on the social contexts in which people are viewed and photographed, we ask–what do the ‘Third World’ people think of Westerners gazing at them, and their surroundings? How do Western tourists react when photographed by domestic tourists? What are the power relations within which the photographer and the photographed are located? We recognize that no simplistic analyses are possible in the postcolonial context.

In this review we summarize the core roles of snails in the life cycles of the parasites they host, their clinical manifestations and disease distributions, as well as snail control methods. Main body: Snails have four roles in the life cycles of the parasites they host: as an intermediate host infected by the first-stage larvae, as the only intermediate host infected by miracidia, as the first intermediate host that ingests the parasite eggs are ingested, and as the first intermediate host penetrated by miracidia with or without the second intermediate host being an aquatic animal. Snail-borne parasitic diseases target many organs, such as the lungs, liver, biliary tract, intestines, brain and kidneys, leading to overactive immune responses, cancers, organ failure, infertility and even death. Developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America have the highest incidences of these diseases, while some endemic parasites have developed into worldwide epidemics through the global spread of snails. Physical, chemical and biological methods have been introduced to control the host snail populations to prevent disease. Conclusions: In this review, we summarize the roles of snails in the life cycles of the parasites they host, the worldwide distribution of parasite-transmitting snails, the epidemiology and pathogenesis of snail-transmitted parasitic diseases, and the existing snail control measures, which will contribute to further understanding the snail-parasite relationship and new strategies for controlling snail-borne parasitic diseases. © 2018 The Author(s).",Epidemiology; Pathogenesis; Snail control; Snail-borne parasitic diseases,angiostrongyliasis; clonorchiasis; fascioliasis; fasciolopsiasis; geographic information system; immune response; infertility; life cycle assessment; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; paragonimiasis; parasite control; parasite transmission; parasitosis; pathogenesis; priority journal; remote sensing; Review; schistosomiasis,Review

(C. comosa) or Wan chak motluk Zingiberaceae family, is widely used in Thai traditional medicine for treatment of gynecological problems as well as relief of postmenopausal symptoms. Since C. comosa contains phytoestrogen and causes lipid lowering effect by an unknown mechanism, we investigated its effect on adiposity and lipid metabolism in estrogen-deprived rats. Materials and methods Adult female rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and received daily doses of either a phytoestrogen from C. comosa [(3R)–1,7-diphenyl-(4E,6E)–4,6-heptadien-3-ol; DPHD], C. comosa extract, or estrogen (17β-estradiol; E2) for 12 weeks. Adipose tissue mass, serum levels of lipids and adipokines were determined. In addition, genes and proteins involved in lipid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation in visceral adipose tissue were analyzed. Results Ovariectomy for 12 weeks elevated level of serum lipids and increased visceral fat mass and adipocyte size. These alterations were accompanied with the up-regulation of lipogenic mRNA and protein expressions including LXR-α SREBP1c and their downstream targets. OVX rats showed decrease in proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation including AMPK-α and PPAR-α in adipose tissue, as well as alteration of adipokines; leptin and adiponectin. Treatments with E2, DPHD or C. comosa extract in OVX rats prevented an increase in adiposity, down-regulated lipogenic genes and proteins with marked increases in the protein levels of AMPK-α and PPAR-α. These findings indicated that their lipid lowering effects were mediated via the suppression of lipid synthesis in concert with an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Conclusions C. comosa exerts a lipid lowering effect in the estrogen deficient rats through the modulations of lipid synthesis and AMPK-α activity in adipose tissues, supporting the use of this plant for health promotion in the post-menopausal women. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Anti-adiposity; Curcuma comosa; Diarylheptanoid; Ovariectomy; Phytoestrogen,acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; acyl coenzyme A desaturase 1; adiponectin; Curcuma comosa extract; estrogen; fatty acid synthase; glucose; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin; leptin; lipid; liver X receptor alpha; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; plant extract; resistin; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; cell size; cholesterol blood level; comparative study; controlled study; Curcuma; Curcuma comosa; cytokine release; down regulation; dyslipidemia; fatty acid oxidation; female; glucose blood level; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intraperitoneal fat; lipid metabolism; nonhuman; obesity; ovariectomy; protein expression; rat; triacylglycerol blood level; upregulation; uterus weight,Article

Methods: Collaborative retrospective analysis of ARD. Outcome measures were number of surgical interventions, final retinal reattachment, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at last follow-up. Results: Seventeen eyes of 16 patients (12 males; mean age =37.8 years) had the following complications at presentation: macula off (14), total (7) or inferior detachment (5), proliferative vitreoretinopathy (5), detectable break (16), lattice (5), horseshoe tears (9), and giant tear or dialysis (4). Mean number of interventions was 1.8 (range =1–5) and included cryopexy (15) with scleral buckle (11), and/or vitrectomy (8). Mean initial BCVA was counting finger (CF) 1 m and at last follow-up (mean 77 months) CF4m with mean improvement of 4.5 lines (early treatment diabetic retinopathy study) (P=0.05). Intraoperative choroidal hemorrhage occurred in three eyes. The retina was finally attached in 14 eyes, with residual inferior detachment in three eyes with silicone oil in situ. Silicone oil was kept in six of seven eyes because of residual inferior detachment (3) and removal of silicone oil, which led to redetachment (1) or fear of redetachment (2). Conclusion: Repair of ARD may require several interventions, with the need to keep silicone oil in several cases due to nystagmus and reduced melanin pigment. © 2018 Mansour et al.",Cryopexy; Foveal hypoplasia; Nystagmus; Retinal detachment; Scleral buckle; Silicone oil; Vitrectomy,silicone oil; adolescent; adult; albinism; Article; best corrected visual acuity; blunt trauma; child; choroid hemorrhage; clinical article; clinical outcome; controlled study; cryosurgery; dialysis; female; follow up; human; macular edema; male; middle aged; peroperative complication; retina detachment; retina tear; retinopexy; retrospective study; vitrectomy; vitreoretinopathy,Article

In Thailand, the National Antidote Project (NAP) has operated since November 2010 to manage the national antidote stockpile, educate the healthcare providers on appropriate antidote use, and evaluate antidote usage. Objective: To evaluate the effect of NAP implementation on mortality rate and antidote use in cyanide poisoning cases arising from ingestion of cyanide or cyanogenic glycoside. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort of poisoning cases involving cyanide or cyanogenic glycoside ingestion reported to Ramathibodi Poison Center from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2015. Mortality rate, antidote use, and appropriateness of antidote use (defined as correct indication, proper dosing regimen, and administration within 90 min) before and after NAP implementation were compared. Association between parameters and fatal outcomes was analyzed. Results: A total of 343 cases involving cyanide or cyanogenic glycoside ingestion were reported to Ramathibodi Poison Center. There were 213 cases (62.1%) during NAP (Project group) and 130 cases (37.9%) pre-NAP implementation (Before group). Implementation of NAP led to increased antidote use (39.9% in Project group versus 24.6% in Before group) and a higher rate of appropriate antidote use (74.1% in Project group versus 50.0% in Before group). All 30 deaths were presented with initial severe symptoms. Cyanide chemical source and self-harm intent were associated with death (OR: 12.919, 95% CI: 4.863–39.761 and OR: 10.747, 95% CI: 3.884–28.514, respectively). No difference in overall mortality rate (13 [10.0%] deaths before versus 17 [8.0%] deaths after NAP) was found. In subgroup analysis of 80 cases with initial severe symptoms, NAP and appropriate antidote use reduced mortality (OR: 0.327, 95% CI: 0.106–0.997 and OR: 0.024, 95% CI: 0.004–0.122, respectively). In the multivariate analysis of the cases with initial severe symptoms, presence of the NAP and appropriate antidote use independently reduced the risk of death (OR: 0.122, 95% CI: 0.023–0.633 and OR: 0.034, 95% CI: 0.007–0.167, respectively), adjusted for intent of exposure, cyanide source, age, and sex. Conclusions: After NAP implementation, both antidote use and appropriate antidote use increased. In cases presenting with severe symptoms, presence of the NAP and appropriate antidote use independently reduced the risk of mortality. © 2017 The Author(s).

Methods We undertook a post hoc pooled analysis of febrile episodes that occurred during the active surveillance phase (the 25 months after the first study injection) of 2 pivotal phase III, placebo-controlled CYD-TDV efficacy studies that involved ≥31000 children aged 2-16 years across 10 countries in Asia and Latin America. Virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) episode was defined with a positive test for dengue nonstructural protein 1 antigen or dengue polymerase chain reaction. Probable dengue episode was serologically defined as (1) IgM-positive acute- or convalescent-phase sample, or (2) IgG-positive acute-phase sample and ≥4-fold IgG increase between acute- and convalescent-phase samples. Results There were 1284 VCD episodes (575 and 709 in the CYD-TDV and placebo groups, respectively) and 17673 other febrile episodes (11668 and 6005, respectively). Compared with VCD, the sensitivity and specificity of probable dengue definition were 93.1% and 77.2%, respectively. Overall positive and negative predictive values were 22.9% and 99.5%, respectively, reflecting the much lower probability of correctly confirming probable dengue in a population including a vaccinated cohort. Vaccination-induced bias toward false-positive diagnosis was more pronounced among individuals seronegative at baseline. Conclusions Caution will be required when interpreting IgM and IgG data obtained during routine surveillance in those vaccinated with CYD-TDV. There is an urgent need for new practical, dengue-specific diagnostic algorithms now that CYD-TDV is approved in a number of dengue-endemic countries. © 2017 The Author(s).

Methods: Ten warfarin dosing algorithms derived from different population including Caucasian, East Asian, South-East Asian, and mixed races were selected and tested with clinical and genetic data of Thai patients. Comparative performances of these algorithms were tested using mean dose error (MDE) between actual warfarin maintenance dose (AWMD) and predicted dose generated by each dosing algorithm, and percentage of ideal dose prediction (IDP). Sensitivity analysis for predictive accuracy was also conducted by stratifying patients into low (AWMD ≤21 mg/wk), intermediate (AWMD >21 to <49 mg/wk), and high maintenance dose (AWMD ≥49 mg/wk) groups. Results: Data of 165 patients were included for the analyses. Mean actual warfarin dose of the study population was 25.03 ± 10.53 mg/wk. Large variability of MDE, ranging from −12.11 to 11.24 mg/wk, among algorithms was observed. International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, Gage et al, and Ohno et al algorithms had comparable performances to Sangviroon et al algorithm, as observed by MDE of <1 mg/wk with percentage of IDP ≥40%. Further sensitivity analyses among patients requiring low and intermediate maintenance doses confirmed such findings with IDP percentage ranging from 37.8% to 59.2%. Among high-dose group, only Ohno et al and Sarapakdi et al algorithms had acceptable performance. Conclusions: Warfarin PGx-guided dosing algorithms derived from large, mixed population performed comparably to Sangviroon et al algorithm.

It causes a spectrum of illness that could be due to qualitative and/or quantitative difference(s) of the natural killer (NK) cell responses during acute DENV infection. This view prompted us to perform a detailed phenotypic comparative characterization of NK cell subsets from DENV-infected patients with dengue fever (DF), patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and healthy controls. The activation/differentiation molecules, CD69 and CD57 and a variety of tissue homing molecules were analysed on the CD56hi CD16− and CD56lo CD16+ NK cells. Although there was no increase in the frequency of the total NK cells during DENV infection compared with the healthy individuals, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the CD56hi CD16− subset and the frequency of CD69 expression by both NK cell subsets during the febrile phase of infection. We also found an increase in the frequencies of cells expressing CD69 and CD57 in the CD56lo CD16+ subset compared with those in the CD56hi CD16− subset. Moreover, although the CD56lo CD16+ subset contained a high frequency of cells expressing skin-homing markers, the CD56hi CD16− subset contained a high frequency of cells expressing bone marrow and lymph node trafficking markers. Interestingly, no differences of these NK cell subsets were noted in samples from patients with DF versus those with DHF. These findings suggest that activation and differentiation and the patterns of tissue homing molecules of the two major NK cell subsets are different and that these might play a critical role in the immune response against acute DENV infection. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",cell trafficking; dengue infection; innate immunity; natural killer cells,beta1 integrin; beta7 integrin; CD103 antigen; CD56 antigen; CD57 antigen; CD69 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR2; chemokine receptor CCR5; chemokine receptor CCR7; chemokine receptor CCR9; chemokine receptor CXCR3; chemokine receptor CXCR4; interleukin 2 receptor beta; interleukin 2 receptor gamma; L selectin; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9; adolescent; adult; Article; bone marrow; child; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; dengue; dengue hemorrhagic fever; disease severity; female; flow cytometry; human; human cell; lymph node; lymphocyte activation; lymphocyte differentiation; male; natural killer cell; priority journal; skin,Article

This study aimed to assess the frequencies of erroneous positioning during three periods: before retraining of the technologists (BR), after retraining (AR), and at the current timepoint 8 years after retraining (C). The BMD images of the first 150 consecutive patients who underwent DXA of the lumbar spine and hip during each of the three periods were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were excluded if they had severe scoliosis, rendering proper positioning impossible. Each BMD image was assessed by an International Society of Clinical Densitometry certified clinical densitometrist who was blinded to the date of the initial examination. For the lumbar spine in the BR group, the criteria frequently not met were inclusion of both iliac crests (33.8%), straightness (30.3%), and midline positioning (20.4%); the respective frequencies were significantly reduced to 0.8%−5.6%, 2.1%−3.0%, and 0%−2.8% in the AR and C groups (p < 0.05). For the hip in the BR group, the criteria frequently not met were straightness (52.8%) and internal rotation (21.8%); the respective frequencies were significantly reduced to 0%−4.2% and 8.3%−8.4% in the AR and C groups (p < 0.05). Overall improper positioning in the BR group was 49.3% and 57.3% at the lumbar spine and the hip, respectively; the respective frequencies were reduced to 9.3% and 12.7% in the AR group, and to 2.7% and 7.3% in the C group.

Various vegetable oils were screened and the results showed that coconut oil provided the highest curcuminoid solubility, suitable PIT and the largest NE region in the ternary phase diagram for the formation of NE (droplets size 20–100 nm and polydispersity below 0.2). Curcuminoid-loaded NE comprising 8.3 wt% coconut oil with different curcuminoid and RH40 concentrations were prepared. The results revealed that at the RH40 concentration of ≤10 wt%, an increase in curcuminoid concentration resulted in the migration of curcuminoids towards the oil phase, affirmed by the observation of increases in droplet size. Contrarily, no significant changes (p >.05) in droplet size with increased curcuminoid concentration were observed with the NE of RH40 > 10 wt%, related to the migration of curcuminoid molecules from oil droplets into microemulsion droplets in the aqueous phase. All formulations were physically stable for at least two months. However, the degradation of curcuminoids increased with increased temperature and surfactant concentration.

Nevertheless, the diagnostic performance and the appropriate cutoff point of the ESAS for the assessment of depression in these patients have varied in the studies. Purpose: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and the optimal cutoff point for the ESAS for the assessment of depression in patients with cancer. Data Sources: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane library databases from inception to September 18, 2016. Study Selection: Paired reviewers independently screened abstracts and full-text articles for all cross-sectional studies published in English and compared these with the ESAS in the depression (ESAS-D) subscale with reference to standard tests for the assessment of depression. Data Extraction: Two reviewers serially abstracted the data and independently assessed the risk of bias by using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2. Data Synthesis: A total of 6 studies were eligible for review. Our meta-analysis showed the optimal cutoff point of the ESAS-D ≥ 4, with pooled sensitivity and specificity at 53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38%-67%) and 90% (95% CI: 82%-94%), respectively. The positive likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio of the ESAS-D ≥ 4 were 5.2 (95% CI: 3.1-8.6) and 10 (95% CI: 5-19). There was a high degree of heterogeneity between the studies (P value &lt;.001, I2 = 96%). Conclusion: We suggest that an ESAS-D ≥ 4 could be used to detect possible cases of depression in patients with cancer. Registration: Our study protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews on October 4, 2016, and was last updated on January 11, 2017 (registration number CRD42016048288). © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",cancer patients; depression; ESAS; sensitivity; systematic review,adult; article; cancer patient; Cinahl; Cochrane Library; cross-sectional study; data extraction; data synthesis; depression assessment; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; male; Medline; meta analysis; quality control; registration; risk assessment; Scopus; sensitivity and specificity; statistical significance; symptom assessment; systematic review,Article

The PpelOT/VP-like mRNA was 626 bp long and it encoded the preprohormones containing 158 amino acids. This preprohormone consisted of a signal peptide, an active nonapeptide (CFITNCPPG) followed by the dibasic cleavage site (GKR), and the neurophysin domain. Sequence alignment of the PpelOT/VP-like peptide with those of other animals revealed strong molecular conservation. Phylogenetic analysis of encoded proteins revealed that the PpelOT/VP-like peptide was clustered within the group of crustacean OT/VP-like peptide. Analysis by RT-PCR revealed the expression of mRNA transcripts in the eyestalk, brain, ventral nerve cord (VNC), ovary, intestine and gill. The in situ hybridization demonstrated the cellular localizations of the transcripts in the central nervous system (CNS) and ovary tissues. In the eyestalk, the mRNA expression was observed in the neuronal clusters 1–5 but not in the sinus gland complex. In the brain and the VNC, the transcripts were detected in all neuronal clusters but not in the glial cell. In the ovary, the transcripts were found in all stages of oocytes (Oc1, Oc2, Oc3, and Oc4). In addition, synthetic PpelOT/VP-like peptide could inhibit steroid release from the ovary. The knowledge gained from this study will provide more understanding on neuro-endocrinological controls in this crab species. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Molecular cloning; Oxytocin/vasopressin-like peptide; Portunus pelagicus; Steroid release,complementary DNA; messenger RNA; methionine; neurophysin; nonapeptide; oxytocin; signal peptide; transcriptome; vasopressin; 5' untranslated region; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; female; in situ hybridization; maximum likelihood method; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; ovary; ovary tissue; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; Portunus pelagicus; steroid release; ventral root,Article

Does the uneven distribution mean that not everyone benefits from new technologies to the same extent, or do some people experience an absolute disadvantage during this process? I explore this question through the case study of curative healthcare access in the context of rapid mobile phone uptake in rural India, contributing thus to an important yet surprisingly under-researched aspect of the social implications of (mobile) technology diffusion. Inspired by a previous analysis of cross-sectional data from rural India, I hypothesise that health systems increasingly adapt to mobile phone users where phones have diffused widely. This adaptation will leave poor non-adopters worse off than before and increases healthcare inequities. I use a panel of 12,003 rural households with an illness in 2005 and 2012 from the Indian Human Development Survey to test this hypothesis. Based on village-cluster robust fixed-effects linear probability models, I find that (a) mobile phone diffusion is significantly and negatively linked to various forms of rural healthcare access, suggesting that health systems increasingly adapt to phone use and discriminate against non-users; that (b) poor rural households without mobile phones experience more adverse effects compared to more affluent households, which indicates a struggle and competition for healthcare access among marginalised groups; and that (c) no effects emerge for access to public doctors, which implies that some healthcare providers are less responsive to mobile phone use than others. Overall, my findings indicate that the rural Indian healthcare system gradually adapts to increasing mobile phone use at the expense of non-users. I conclude that rapid mobile phone diffusion creates an opportunity to improve people's access to healthcare in rural India, but it also creates new forms of marginalisation among poor rural households. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Asia; Digital inclusion; Healthcare; Household panel data; India; Mobile phones,health care; marginalization; mobile phone; panel data; rural area; technology diffusion; India,Article

Three groups of 10 rats were dermally exposed to three different doses (high, middle and low) for 28 consecutive days. The rats showed significant changes in body, liver, kidneys and adrenals weights. Significant changes were observed in various biological parameters including hematotoxicity (increased leukocyte and platelet counts, percent neutrophil, decreased RBC count, percent lymphocyte and eosinophil), hepatotoxicity (increased serum AST, decreased serum ALP, cholesterol, triglyceride, serum protein and albumin), and immunotoxicity (decrease in numbers of NK cells, decrease splenic proliferative response to LPS, and increase in serum IgG).

There are currently no anti-DENV drugs available, and there has been an intensive search for effective anti-DENV agents that can inhibit all four DENV serotypes. In this study, we tested whether vivo-morpholino oligomers (vivo-MOs), whose effect on DENV infection has not previously been studied, can inhibit DENV infection. Vivo-MOs were designed to target the top of 3’ stem-loop (3’ SL) in the 3’ UTR of the DENV genome and tested for inhibition of DENV infection in monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cells and human lung epithelial carcinoma (A549) cells. The results showed that vivo-MOs could bind to a DENV RNA sequence and markedly reduce DENV-RNA, protein, and virus production in infected Vero and A549 cells. Vivo-MOs at a concentration of 4 µM could inhibit DENV production by more than 104-fold when compared to that of an untreated control. In addition, vivo-MOs also inhibited DENV production in U937 cells and primary human monocytes. Therefore, vivo-MOs targeting to the 3’ SL in the 3’ UTR of DENV genomes are effective and have the potential to be developed as anti-DENV agents. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"antivirus agent; morpholino oligonucleotide; A-549 cell line; animal; base pairing; chemistry; Chlorocebus aethiops; conformation; Dengue virus; drug effects; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; inverted repeat; metabolism; monocyte; primary cell culture; U-937 cell line; Vero cell line; virology; virus genome; virus replication; A549 Cells; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Base Pairing; Cercopithecus aethiops; Dengue Virus; Genome, Viral; Humans; Inverted Repeat Sequences; Monocytes; Morpholinos; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Primary Cell Culture; U937 Cells; Vero Cells; Virus Replication",Article

However, surprisingly little has been exchanged to date, and both realms of inquiry and practice have progressed mostly independent of each other. This paper builds on a session held at the 7th World Fisheries Congress in Busan, South Korea, in May 2016, which explored crossover lessons between marine and freshwater realms, and included case studies of four MPAs and five FPAs (or clusters of FPAs) from nine countries. This review uses the case studies to explore similarities, differences, and transferrable lessons between MPAs and FPAs under five themes: (1) ecological system; (2) establishment approaches; (3) effectiveness monitoring; (4) sustaining APAs; and (5) challenges and external threats. Ecological differences between marine and freshwater environments may necessitate different approaches for collecting species and habitat data to inform APA design, establishment and monitoring, but once collected, similar spatial ecological tools can be applied in both realms. In contrast, many similarities exist in the human dimension of both MPA and FPA establishment and management, highlighting clear opportunities for exchanging lessons related to stakeholder engagement and support, and for using similar socio-economic and governance assessment methods to address data gaps in both realms. Regions that implement MPAs and FPAs could work together to address shared challenges, such as developing mechanisms for diversified and sustained funding, and employing integrated coastal/watershed management to address system-level threats. Collaboration across realms could facilitate conservation of diadromous species in both marine and freshwater habitats. Continued exchange and increased collaboration would benefit both realms, and may be facilitated by defining shared terminology, holding cross-disciplinary conferences or sessions, publishing inclusive papers, and proposing joint projects.

The principal aims of treatment are typically to prevent infection while allowing the wound to heal. This study therefore sought to prepare the hydrogel pads based on silver nanoparticles. To be effective as a wound dressing, the gel fraction, mechanical properties, and swelling capacity of the proposed material must be suitable, and it was found that PVP/alginate/chitosan in the ratio of 10:1.2:1.8 showed the required properties. Furthermore, the silver nanoparticles-based hydrogel was also found to offer antibacterial properties and an absence of cytotoxicity when tested towards human keratinocytes (HaCaT), L929 mouse fibroblasts, and human dermal fibroblasts adult (HDFa). The proposed material was then compared with commercially available dressings (ACTICOAT™ Algivon®, and Suprasorb® A + Ag) with findings showing the superiority of the proposed hydrogel in terms of reduced cost, non-cytotoxicity, and swelling, while the ability to reduce bacteria was shown to be equal to that of the commercial alternatives. Therefore, it can be concluded that silver nanoparticle-based hydrogel offers considerable potential to relieve pressure ulcers through its application as a wound dressing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Alginate; Chitosan; Hydrogel; Pressure ulcer; Silver nanoparticles; Wound dressing,alginic acid; chitosan; povidone; silver nanoparticle; Acinetobacter baumannii; adult; animal cell; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterium colony; cell viability; colony forming unit; controlled study; cytotoxicity; decubitus; disk diffusion; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; HaCat cell line; human; human cell; hydrogel; L cell line; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; mouse; nonhuman; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; skin fibroblast; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis; vancomycin resistant Enterococcus,Article

Background: SSI is common in appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. DPC is preferentially used over PC, but its efficacy is still controversial. Methods: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted in 6 hospitals in Thailand, enrolling patients with gangrenous and ruptured appendicitis. Patients were randomized to PC (ie, immediately wound closure) or DPC (ie, wound closure at postoperative days 3-5). Superficial SSI was defined by the Center for Disease Control criteria. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, length of stay, recovery time, quality of life, and cost of treatment. Results: In all, 303 and 304 patients were randomized to PC and DPC groups, and 5 and 4 patients were lost to follow-up, respectively, leaving 300 and 298 patients in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The superficial SSI rate was lower in the PC than DPC groups [ie, 7.3% (95% confidence interval 4.4, 10.3) vs 10% (95% CI 6.6, 13.3)] with a risk difference (RD) of -2.7% (-7.1%, 1.9%), but this RD was not significant. Postoperative pain, length of stay, recovery times, and quality of life were nonsignificantly different with corresponding RDs of 0.3 (-2.5, 3.0), -0.1 (-0.5, 0.3), -0.2 (-0.8, 0.4), and 0.02 (-0.01, 0.04), respectively. However, costs for PC were 2083 (1410, 2756) Baht cheaper than DPC (∼$60 USD). Conclusions: Superficial SSI rates for the PC group were slightly lower than DPC group, but this did not reach statistical significance. Costs were significantly lower for the PC group. © 2017 The Author(s).

Low- and middle-income countries face difficulties implementing feasible strategies to fulfill this ambitious goal. To contribute to the revitalization of Thailand’s marine ecosystems, we investigated the level of tobacco product waste (TPW) on Thailand’s public beaches. We conducted a cross-sectional observational survey at two popular public beaches. Research staff collected cigarette butts over two eight-hour days walking over a one-kilometer stretch of beach. We also compiled and analyzed data on butts collected from sieved sand at 11 popular beaches throughout Thailand’s coast, with 10 samples of sieved sand collected per beach. Our survey at two beaches yielded 3067 butts in lounge areas, resulting in a mean butt density of 0.44/m2. At the 11 beaches, sieved sand samples yielded butt densities ranging from 0.25 to 13.3/m2, with a mean butt density of 2.26/m2 (SD = 3.78). These densities show that TPW has become a serious problem along Thailand’s coastline. Our findings are comparable with those in other countries. We report on government and civil society initiatives in Thailand that are beginning to address marine TPW. The solution will only happen when responsible parties, especially and primarily tobacco companies, undertake actions to eliminate TPW. © 2018 by the authors.

Anthropological and sociological research has illuminated the role and impact of rapid point-of-care malaria testing. This paper expands our knowledge about the social implications of non-malarial POCT, using the case study of a C-reactive-protein point-of-care testing (CRP POCT) clinical trial with febrile patients at primary-care-level health centres in Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand. We investigate the social role of CRP POCT through its interactions with (a) the healthcare workers who use it, (b) the patients whose routine care is affected by the test, and (c) the existing patient-health system linkages that might resonate or interfere with CRP POCT. We conduct a thematic analysis of data from 58 purposively sampled pre- and post-intervention patients and healthcare workers in August 2016 and May 2017. We find widespread positive attitudes towards the test among patients and healthcare workers. Patients’ views are influenced by an understanding of CRP POCT as a comprehensive blood test that provides specific diagnosis and that corresponds to notions of good care. Healthcare workers use the test to support their negotiations with patients but also to legitimise ethical decisions in an increasingly restrictive antibiotic policy environment. We hypothesise that CRP POCT could entail greater patient adherence to recommended antibiotic treatment, but it could also encourage riskier health behaviour and entail potentially adverse equity implications for patients across generations and socioeconomic strata. Our empirical findings inform the clinical literature on increasingly propagated point-of-care biomarker tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions, and we contribute to the anthropological and sociological literature through a novel conceptualisation of the patient-health system interface as an activity space into which biomarker testing is introduced. © 2018",Antibiotic use; Antimicrobial resistance; Biomarker testing; C-reactive protein point-of-care testing; Primary care; Qualitative research; Social research; Thailand,C reactive protein; antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial activity; biomarker; developing world; health worker; primary health care; protein; qualitative analysis; research method; testing method; adult; antibiotic therapy; Article; case study; controlled study; female; health care personnel; health care policy; health care system; help seeking behavior; human; informed consent; intervention study; male; patient care; point of care testing; prescription; Thailand; thematic analysis; Chiang Rai; Northern Region [Thailand]; Thailand,Article

Besides biomedical research and political efforts, modern information technology is playing a key role in many attempts at fighting the disease. One of the barriers toward a successful mortality reduction has been inadequate malaria diagnosis in particular. To improve diagnosis, image analysis software and machine learning methods have been used to quantify parasitemia in microscopic blood slides. This article gives an overview of these techniques and discusses the current developments in image analysis and machine learning for microscopic malaria diagnosis. We organize the different approaches published in the literature according to the techniques used for imaging, image preprocessing, parasite detection and cell segmentation, feature computation, and automatic cell classification. Readers will find the different techniques listed in tables, with the relevant articles cited next to them, for both thin and thick blood smear images.

Recently we have identified multiple proteins as targets of immunity against Plasmodium falciparum using African serum samples. To investigate whether potential targets of clinical immunity differ with transmission intensity, we assessed immune responses in residents of low malaria transmission region in Thailand. Malaria asymptomatic volunteers (Asy: n = 19) and symptomatic patients (Sym: n = 21) were enrolled into the study. Serum immunoreactivity to 186 wheat germ cell-free system (WGCFS)-synthesized recombinant P. falciparum asexual-blood stage proteins were determined by AlphaScreen, and subsequently compared between the study groups. Forty proteins were determined as immunoreactive with antibody responses to 35 proteins being higher in Asy group than in Sym group. Among the 35 proteins, antibodies to MSP3, MSPDBL1, RH2b, and MSP7 were significantly higher in Asy than Sym (unadjusted p < 0.005) suggesting these antigens may have a protective role in clinical malaria. MSP3 reactivity remained significantly different between Asy and Sym groups even after multiple comparison adjustments (adjusted p = 0.033). Interestingly, while our two preceding studies using African sera were conducted differently (e.g., cross-sectional vs. longitudinal design, observed clinical manifestation vs. functional activity), those studies similarly identified MSP3 and MSPDBL1 as potential targets of protective immunity. This study further provides a strong rationale for the application of WGCFS-based immunoprofiling to malaria vaccine candidate and biomarker discovery even in low or reduced malaria transmission settings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Blood-stage vaccine; High-throughput immunoscreening; Malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; Thailand; Wheat germ cell-free system (WGCFS),malaria vaccine; adolescent; adult; African; antibody response; Article; asymptomatic infection; blood sampling; cell free system; child; clinical assessment; controlled study; cross-sectional study; endemic disease; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; follow up; human; humoral immunity; immunity; immunoreactivity; in vitro study; longitudinal study; major clinical study; malaria falciparum; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; observational study; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; protein analysis; resident; Thailand; volunteer; wheat germ,Article

Previous results have shown that AMPH-induced dopamine neurotransmitter release, reactive oxygen species formation, and degenerative protein aggregation lead to neuronal death. Melatonin, a powerful antioxidant, plays a role as a neuroprotective agent. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the protective effect of melatonin on AMPH-induced hippocampal damage in the postnatal rat acts through the dopaminergic pathway. Four-day-old postnatal rats were subcutaneously injected with 5-10 mg/kg AMPH and pretreated with 10 mg/kg melatonin prior to AMPH exposure for seven days. The results showed that melatonin decreased the AMPH-induced hippocampal neuronal degeneration in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3. Melatonin attenuated the reduction in the expression of hippocampal synaptophysin, PSD-95, α-synuclein, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor protein and mRNA caused by AMPH. Melatonin attenuated the AMPH-induced reduction in dopamine transporter (DAT) protein expression in the hippocampus and the reduction in mRNA expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Immunofluorescence demonstrated that melatonin not only prevented the AMPH-induced loss of DAT and NMDA receptor but also prevented AMPH-induced α-synuclein overexpression in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3. Melatonin decreased the AMPH-induced reduction in the protein and mRNA of the NMDA receptor downstream signaling molecule, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and the melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2). This study showed that melatonin prevented AMPH-induced toxicity in the hippocampus of postnatal rats possibly via its antioxidative effect and mitochondrial protection. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In the present study, SP extracted from a European red seaweed Irish moss Chondrus crispus was chemically analyzed, SP content extracted and the immune-response effect on wild Irish mussels Mytilus spp. investigated for the first time. A high percent yield of SP was extracted from C. crispus and the immune-stimulant activity of SP was assessed in a laboratory trial with mussels exposed to three different treatments of low (10 μg mL−1), medium (20 μg mL−1) and high (50 μg mL−1) SP dose concentrations and a control mussel group with no exposure to SP. An initial mussel sample was processed prior to the trial commencing and mussels were subsequently sampled on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 post SP exposure. Both cell, humoral and immune related gene responses including haemocyte cell viability, haemocyte counts, lysozyme activity and expression of immune related genes (defensin, mytimycin and lysozyme mRNA) were assessed. No mussel mortalities were observed in either the treated or non-treated groups. Mussels exposed with SP showed an increase in haemocyte cell viability and the total number of haemocytes compared to control mussels. Lysozyme activity was also higher in treated mussels. Additionally, up-regulated expression of defensin, mytimycin and lysozyme mRNA was observed in SP treated mussels shortly after exposure (on Days 1, 2, and 3) to SP. These results indicate that a high quality yield of SP can be readily extracted from C. crispus and more importantly based on the animal model used in this study, SP extracted from C. crispus can rapidly induce health enhancing activities in Mytilus spp. at a cellular, humoral and molecular level and with a prolonged effect up to ten days post treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Chondrus crispus; Immune responses; Mytilus spp; Sulfated polysaccharides,defensin; lysozyme; messenger RNA; mytimycin; polysaccharide sulfate; unclassified drug; aquaculture; Article; blood cell count; cell viability; Chondrus; Chondrus crispus; controlled study; enzyme activity; immune response; immune-related gene; immunostimulation; Mytilus; nonhuman; priority journal; seaweed; upregulation,Article

Materials and methods: A cross sectional design. Data collected from doctors using an anonymous online, questionnaire. Results: Hundred seventy-five from LMICs and 43 from HICs participated. Barriers in LMICs were lack of formal training (Likert score median 3 [inter quartile range 3]), lack of nurses (3[3]) and low wages (3[4]). Strategies for LMICs improvement were formal training of ICU staff (4[3]), an increase in number of ICU nurses (4[2]), collection of outcome data (3[4]), as well as maintenance of available equipment [3(3)]. The most useful role of HIC ICU staff was training of LMIC staff (4[2]). Donation of equipment [2(4)], drugs [2(4)], and supplies (2[4]) perceived to be of limited usefulness. The most striking difference between HIC and LMIC staff was the perception on the lack of physician leadership as an obstacle to ICU functioning (4[3] vs. 0[2], p < 0.005). Conclusion: LMICs ICU workers perceived lack of training, lack of nurses, and low wages as major barriers to functioning. Training, increase of nurse workforce, and collection of outcome data were proposed as useful strategies to improve LMIC ICU services. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",ICU workers; Improving ICU services; Perceptions; Resource-limited settings,adult; aged; anonymised data; Article; cross-sectional study; device maintenance; economic evaluation; health personnel attitude; high income country; human; intensive care unit; intensivist; leadership; low income country; middle aged; middle income country; nurse training; nursing shortage; physician attitude; questionnaire; salary; total quality management,Article

We investigated whether HTR2C:rs518147 (-697G/C), rs12836771 (A/G), LEP: rs7799039 (-2548G/A) and LEPR:rs1137101 (668A/G) are related to MS in psychotic disorder patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Methods: A cross-sectional study including 200 patients was conducted; genetic polymorphisms in HTR2C (rs518147 and rs12836771), LEP (rs7799039) and LEPR (rs1137101) were genotyped. The presence of MS was evaluated according to the 2005 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Asia criteria. The associations of genetic factors with the presence of MS are analysed. Key findings: Two SNPs in the HTR2C gene but not LEP and LEPR were associated with the presence of MS after adjustment for the combination of atypical antipsychotics. With respect to the effect of gender after treatment with risperidone and clozapine was statistically significant. Moreover, genotype combinations had no effect on MS. Conclusions: Therefore, HTR2C genetic variants may be involved in the susceptibility to MS in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Additionally, there was a gender effect in the presence of MS. No effect of LEP or LEPR polymorphisms or the combination of HTR2C-LEP and HTR2C-LEPR was observed for the presence of MS. © 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society",atypical antipsychotics; HTR2C; LEP; LEPR; metabolic syndrome,atypical antipsychotic agent; clozapine; leptin; leptin receptor; olanzapine; quetiapine; risperidone; adult; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease classification; disease predisposition; female; gene; genotype; HTR2C gene; human; International Diabetes Federation Asia criteria; LEP gene; LEPR gene; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; psychosis; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; Thailand,Article

Methods: We tested the adhesive Clearfil S3 Bond Plus and 4 derived experimental ‘LUB’ (‘Leuven Univesity Bond’) adhesives (all from Kuraray Noritake), namely ‘LUB-CQ/amine_high’ ‘LUB-CQ/amine_low’ ‘LUB-TPO_high’ and ‘LUB-TPO_low’ respectively containing 2.0 wt% camphorquinone (CQ) and 2.0 wt% EDMAB (amine), 0.35 wt% CQ and 0.35 wt% amine, 2.0 wt% TPO, and 0.35 wt% TPO. For DC, each adhesive was applied onto glass or dentin prior to being cured (Bluephase 20i; Ivoclar Vivadent: “high mode”) for 10 s. DC was measured at 5 min, 10 min, 1 h, 24 h and 1 week using micro-Raman spectroscopy (SENTERRA; BrukerOptik). For mini-iFT, each adhesive was bonded to 320-grit SiC-paper ground dentin and covered with composite (Z100; 3 M ESPE). The restored teeth were cut in sticks (1.5 × 2.0 × 16 mm), after which a single-gradient notch was prepared at the adhesive-dentin interface using a 150-μm diamond blade. The micro-specimens were loaded until failure in a 4-point bending test and the mini-iFT in term of KQvM was calculated. Results: DC was higher on dentin than on glass. All adhesives were adequately polymerized at 1 week, except for LUB-TPO_low. DC at 5 min was significantly higher for LUB-TPO_high than for both CQ/amine-based adhesives. The highest and most reliable mini-iFT was measured for LUB-CQ/amine_high, despite its 5-min DC was relatively low. No correlation between DC and mini-iFT was found. Significance: Curing of TPO-based adhesives is faster, but the dark cure of the CQ/amine-containing adhesives is more efficient. The differences in curing profiles do affect the mechanical properties of the resultant interfaces at dentin. © 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials",Adhesive; Bonding effectiveness; Degree of conversion; Dentin; Fracture toughness; Glass; Interfacial fracture toughness; Photoinitiator; Polymerization kinetics; TPO,Adhesives; Curing; Fracture; Glass; Glass bonding; Polymerization; Silicon carbide; Bonding effectiveness; Degree of conversion; Dentin; Interfacial fracture toughness; Photo-initiator; Polymerization kinetics; Fracture toughness,Article

Design This qualitative study generated data from semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. This study was conducted at a non-governmental paediatric hospital and in nearby villages in Siem Reap province, Cambodia. A total of ten semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted, involving 27 participants. Iterative data collection and analysis were performed concurrently. Data were analysed by thematic content analysis and the coding structure was developed using relevant literature. Results Participants did not have a clear understanding of what activities related to research compared with those for routine healthcare. Key attitudes towards research were responsibility and trust: personal (trust of the researcher directly) and institutional (trust of the institution as a whole). Villagers believe the village headman holds responsibility for community activities, while the village headman believes that this responsibility should be shared across all levels of the government system. Conclusions It is essential for researchers to understand the structure and relationship within the community they wish to work with in order to develop trust among community participants. This aids effective communication and understanding among all parties, enabling high quality ethical research to be conducted. © 2018 Pol et al.

This study reviewed the main contents of the NSP-AMR and the mandates of relevant implementing agencies and identified challenges and recommends actions to mitigate implementation gaps. Methods: This study analysed the contents of NSP-AMR, reviewed institutional mandates and assessed the implementation gaps among agencies responsible for NSP-AMR. Results: Two of six strategies are related to monitoring and surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial consumption in human and animal. Two other strategies aim to improve antibiotic stewardship and control the spread of AMR in both clinical and farm settings. The remaining two strategies aim to increase knowledge and public awareness on AMR and establish national governance for inter-sectoral actions. Strategies to overcome implementation challenges are sustaining cross-sectoral policy commitments, effective cross-sectoral coordination using One Health approach, generating evidence which guides policy implementation, and improving enforcement capacities in regulatory authorities. Conclusions: To address AMR, Thailand requires significant improvements in implementation capacities in two dimensions. First, technical capacities among implementing agencies are needed to translate policies into practice. Second, governance and organizational capacities enable effective multi-sectoral actions across human, animal, and environmental sectors. © 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health",Antimicrobial resistance; Health systems; National strategic plan; One health; Policy; Thailand,governance approach; health policy; law enforcement; national strategy; policy implementation; public health; Thailand; Animalia,Article

CU2551 has previously been identified and characterized as a photosynthetic microorganism with high potential for H2 production. In the present study, cells of Tetraspora CU2551 were entrapped and immobilized in an alginate matrix with the aim to analyze the effect of cell stacking and a reduced exposure of O2 to the cells. The results showed that the most favorable immobilization conditions were 4% (w/v) of final alginate concentration and a cell concentration of 0.125 mg cell dry wt/mL alginate with a bead diameter of 2.80–3.35 mm. The H2 production yields increased when the immobilized cells were incubated in S-deprived medium and this could be repeated at least for 3 production times. Maximal total H2 production reached 7.68 ± 0.88 mL H2/25 mL medium, corresponding to a rate of 1182.45 ± 24.40 nmol H2/h/mg DW. This production is about 6 times higher compared to by cells in suspension, 2–10 times higher when compared to by other green algae, and 10–50 times higher when comparing with cyanobacteria.

Elucidation of antibody effector functions responsible for protective immunity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition is a major goal for the HIV-1 vaccine field. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an important part of the host defense against pathogens; however, little is known about the role of vaccineelicited IgA and its capacity to mediate antiviral functions. To identify the antiviral functions of HIV-1-specific IgA elicited by vaccination, we cloned HIV-1 envelopespecific IgA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) by memory B cell cultures from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an RV144 vaccinee and produced two IgA clonal cell lines (HG129 and HG130) producing native, nonrecombinant IgA MAbs. The HG129 and HG130 MAbs mediated phagocytosis by monocytes, and HG129 blocked HIV-1 Env glycoprotein binding to galactosylceramide, an alternative HIV-1 receptor. These findings elucidate potential antiviral functions of vaccine-elicited HIV-1 envelope-specific IgA that may act to block HIV-1 acquisition at the portal of entry by preventing HIV-1 binding to galactosylceramide and mediating antibody Fc receptor-mediated virion phagocytosis. Furthermore, these findings highlight the complex and diverse interactions of vaccine-elicited IgA with pathogens that depend on IgA fine specificity and form (e.g., multimeric or monomeric) in the systemic circulation and mucosal compartments. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.",B cell; HIV-1; IgA; Monoclonal antibodies; Nonneutralizing antibodies; Vaccine; Vaccines,"Fc receptor; galactosylceramide; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin A antibody; virus envelope protein; blocking antibody; galactosylceramide; Human immunodeficiency virus antibody; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; immunoglobulin A; monoclonal antibody; antibody specificity; antibody titer; Article; binding site; clonal cell line; conformational transition; controlled study; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; memory cell; molecular recognition; monocyte; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; phagocytosis; priority journal; protein binding; protein protein interaction; virion; virus entry; virus neutralization; cell line; drug effects; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; immunology; phagocytosis; AIDS Vaccines; Antibodies, Blocking; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Cell Line; Galactosylceramides; HIV Antibodies; HIV-1; Humans; Immunoglobulin A; Phagocytosis",Article

To clarify the role that MVMS can play in supporting human health, a series of consensus statements was developed based on expert opinion. Methods: A panel of 14 international experts in nutritional science and health care was convened to develop consensus statements related to using MVMS in supporting optimal human health. The modified Delphi process included 2 rounds of remote voting and a final round of voting at a roundtable meeting where evidence summaries were presented and discussed. The level of agreement with each of 9 statements was rated on a 5-point Likert scale: agree strongly; agree with reservation; undecided; disagree; or disagree strongly. Consensus was predefined as ≥80% of the panel agreeing strongly or agreeing with reservation to a given statement. Findings: Consensus was reached for all statements. The panel determined that MVMS can broadly improve micronutrient intakes when they contain at least the micronutrients that are consumed insufficiently or have limited bioavailability within a specified population. MVMS formulations may also be individualized according to age, sex, life cycle, and/or other selected characteristics. There are specific biological processes and health outcomes associated with deficient, inadequate, and adequate micronutrient levels. Adequate intake is necessary for normal biological functioning required for good health; in some instances, higher than recommended micronutrient intakes have the potential to provide additional health benefits. Meeting daily intakes established by dietary reference values should be an explicit public health goal for individuals and populations. Use of MVMS is one approach to ensure that adequate micronutrient needs are met in support of biological functions necessary to maintain health. Long-term use of MVMS not exceeding the upper limit of recommended intakes has been determined to be safe in healthy adults. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that MVMS are effective for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, for certain otherwise healthy subpopulations (eg, pregnant women, older adults) and some individuals with existing medical conditions who experience inadequacies in micronutrient intake, addressing inadequacies by using MVMS can provide health benefits. Implications: This consensus panel has described key issues related to the use of MVMS among individuals at risk of or presenting with inadequacies in micronutrient intake or biomarker status. © 2018 The Authors",adverse effects; Delphi consensus; dietary supplements; health benefits; multivitamin/multimineral supplements; nutrition,mineral; multimineral; multivitamin; unclassified drug; vitamin; adult; age; breast feeding; child; diet supplementation; dietary supplement; eye disease; health care; human; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; normal human; nutritional science; obesity; pregnant woman; Review; women's health,Review

A major gap in the field is the identification of diverse HIV-1 envelope antigens to evaluate vaccine regimens for binding antibody breadth. In this study, we define unique antigen panels to map HIV-1 vaccine-elicited antibody breadth and durability. Diverse HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins were selected based on genetic and geographic diversity to cover the global epidemic, with a focus on sexually acquired transmitted/founder viruses with a tier 2 neutralization phenotype. Unique antigenicity was determined by nonredundancy (Spearman correlation), and antigens were clustered using partitioning around medoids (PAM) to identify antigen diversity. Cross-validation demonstrated that the PAM method was better than selection by reactivity and random selection. Analysis of vaccine-elicited V1V2 binding antibody in longitudinal samples from the RV144 clinical trial revealed the striking heterogeneity among individual vaccinees in maintaining durable responses. These data support the idea that a major goal for vaccine development is to improve antibody levels, breadth, and durability at the population level. Elucidating the level and durability of vaccine-elicited binding antibody breadth needed for protection is critical for the development of a globally efficacious HIV vaccine. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.",Antibody; Antigenicity; Diversity; Durability; HIV-1; Humoral immunity; Vaccine,"glycoprotein gp 120; gp120 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus antibody; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; animal; genetic variation; genetics; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunology; rhesus monkey; AIDS Vaccines; Animals; Genetic Variation; HIV Antibodies; HIV Envelope Protein gp120; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Macaca mulatta",Article

In addition, it discusses current scientific challenges facing researchers when planning and performing trials of ventilatory support or pharmacological interventions in these patients. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is used in some patients with ARDS. When intubated and mechanically ventilated, ARDS patients should be ventilated with low tidal volumes. A plateau pressure <30 cmH2O is recommended in all patients. It is suggested that a plateau pressure <15 cmH2O should be considered safe. Patient with moderate and severe ARDS should receive higher levels of positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP). Rescue therapies include prone position and neuromuscular blocking agents. Extracorporeal support for decapneisation and oxygenation should only be considered when lungprotective ventilation is no longer possible, or in cases of refractory hypoxaemia, respectively. Tracheotomy is only recommended when prolonged mechanical ventilation is expected. Of all tested pharmacological interventions for ARDS, only treatment with steroids is considered to have benefit. Proper identification of phenotypes, known to respond differently to specific interventions, is increasingly considered important for clinical trials of interventions for ARDS. Such phenotypes could be defined based on clinical parameters, such as the arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio, but biological marker profiles could be more promising. © ERS 2018.",,acetylcysteine; biological marker; glucocorticoid; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; neuromuscular blocking agent; salbutamol; steroid; surfactant; adult respiratory distress syndrome; arterial oxygen tension; Article; artificial ventilation; clinical practice; disease severity; endotracheal intubation; extracorporeal oxygenation; human; interactive ventilatory support; major clinical study; patient care; phenotype; positive end expiratory pressure; prone position; tidal volume; tracheotomy,Article

Calcium supplement from natural sources has been postulated to be more beneficial to bone health than purified CaCO3 because natural sources also contain other nutrients such as certain amino acids that might enhance calcium metabolism. Herein, we examined the effect of calcium supplementation from tuna bone powder and CaCO3 on bones of dams and the offspring. RESULTS: Both forms of calcium supplement, i.e. tuna bone powder and CaCO3, increased maternal bone mineral density (BMD). However, bone histomorphometry revealed that only tuna bone had beneficial effect on maternal bone microstructure, i.e. increased bone formation, decreased bone resorption and increased in bone volume. Regarding the mechanical properties, the decreased ultimate load in non-supplement lactating mothers was restored to the load seen in nulliparous animals by calcium supplementation. Moreover, both tuna bone and CaCO3 supplementation in mothers led to increased milk calcium concentration and consequently increased BMD in the growing offspring. CONCLUSION: Calcium supplement from tuna bone powder was effective in preventing maternal osteopenia. Tuna bone, which is a readily available fishing industrial waste, is a good alternative source of calcium supplement that increases BMD in both lactating mothers and the neonates. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",bone histomorphometry; bone mechanical property; calcium supplementation; lactation-induced bone loss; micro-computed tomography; tuna bone,"calcium; analysis; animal; bone; bone density; chemistry; dietary supplement; female; fortified food; human; lactation; male; metabolic bone disease; metabolism; pathophysiology; rat; tuna; Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; Calcium; Dietary Supplements; Female; Food, Fortified; Humans; Lactation; Male; Rats; Tuna",Article

Mae Klong Basin is rich in term of water availability, but increasing water demands in future due to inter-basin-based water management policy addressed by the national government may strongly influence the changes in water status. WEAP model was implemented to assess the current water supply and demand situations for this basin. Six different scenarios were established to evaluate the response of the basin to increasing demands under two SRES scenarios A2 and B2. The simulated results have shown that currently the water resources in the basin are sufficient to meet the existing needs in the wet season, but water shortage has occurred in the dry periods of 2014 and 2015 due to less rainfall in these years. The results have also shown that more water shortages have occurred under A2 scenario as compared to B2 scenario. Water shortages have occurred in all the developed scenarios indicating that the basin will face water scarcity particularly in the scenario five where transferring water to the adjoining area is difficult to possibly be implemented. The scenario six where a new hydropower project is proposed is considered feasible under both A2 and B2 scenarios and can help in meeting hydropower demands in the basin. It is pertinent to shape more effective policies and regulations in the basin for effective water resources management in reducing water shortage as well as achieving downstream water needs and power benefit in future. © 2018 The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature",Mae Klong Basin; Water resources management; WEAP model,Economics; Hydroelectric power; Water management; Water supply; Hydropower projects; Mae Klong Basin; National governments; River basin management; Water availability; Water management policy; Water resources management; Water supply and demands; Water resources,Article in Press

This study aimed to determine the neuroprotective effects of A. graveolens extract against a Parkinson's disease (PD) model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in C57BL/6 mice. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice treated with MPTP were orally dosed with A. graveolens extract daily for 21 days. Behavioral tests, including a rotarod apparatus, a narrow beam test, a drag test, a grid walk test, a swimming test, and a resting tremor evaluation, were performed. Thereafter, the mice were sacrificed, and monoamine oxidase A and B activity, lipid peroxidation activity, and superoxide anion levels were measured. Immunohistochemical staining of tyrosine hydroxylase was performed to identify dopaminergic neurons. Results: We found that treatment with A. graveolens at dose of 375 mg/kg demonstrated the highest effect and led to significant improvements in behavioral performance, oxidative stress parameters, and monoamine oxidase A and B activity compared with the untreated group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the extract increased the number of neurons immunopositive for tyrosine hydroxylase expression compared with MPTP alone or MPTP with a positive control drug (p < 0.05). Conclusions: We speculated that A. graveolens ameliorated behavioral performance by mediating neuroprotection against MPTP-induced PD via antioxidant effects, related neurotransmitter pathways and an increase in the number of dopaminergic neurons. © 2018 The Author(s).",A. graveolens; Monoamine oxidase; MPTP; Oxidative stress; Tidomet plus; Tyrosine hydroxylase,"amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A; amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme B; antioxidant; Apium graveolens extract; neuroprotective agent; plant extract; superoxide; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; unclassified drug; amine oxidase (flavin containing); antioxidant; neuroprotective agent; plant extract; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; adult; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; Article; brain cortex; celery; cell count; controlled study; corpus striatum; disease severity; dopaminergic nerve cell; drag test; drug effect; enzyme activity; enzyme degradation; enzyme inhibition; experimental behavioral test; immunohistochemistry; latent period; lipid peroxidation; male; mouse; MPTP-induced parkinsonism; narrow beam test; neurochemistry; neuroprotection; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein expression; rotarod test; scoring system; substantia nigra; swimming; tremor; walk test; young adult; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; disease model; drug effects; metabolism; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; Animals; Antioxidants; Apium graveolens; Behavior, Animal; Disease Models, Animal; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Monoamine Oxidase; Neuroprotective Agents; Oxidative Stress; Parkinson Disease; Plant Extracts; Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase",Article

Some studies have reported iodine deficiency among infants and lactating women. We assessed iodine status in infants and lactating women, as well as the iodine content in breast milk. A cross-sectional study enrolled mother-infant pairs (infants aged 4–6 months), who visited Well Child Clinic at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Infants were classified by feeding type as breastfed (BF), mixed breastfed and formula-fed (MF), and formula-fed (FF). Demographic and perinatal data were collected. The urinary iodine concentration (UIC) of infants and lactating women, and breast milk iodine concentration (BMIC) were analyzed. Seventy-one infants were enrolled. The median UIC of infants was 282 mcg/L. Breastfed infants had higher median UIC than formula-fed infants (553 vs. 192 mcg/L; p = 0.002). Forty-eight percent of infants had a UIC more than 300 mcg/L. The median UIC and BMIC of lactating women were 149 and 255 mcg/L, respectively. Among the BF group, the infant UIC was correlated with maternal UIC (rs = 0.857, p = 0.014). Multiple linear regression showed the BMIC to be associated with maternal UIC (β = 4.03, 95% CI [1.34, 6.71]) and maternal weight (β = 8.26, 95%CI [2.76, 13.77]). Iodine nutrition among our study population was adequate. The median UIC of infants and lactating mothers were 282 and 149 mcg/L, respectively. Breastfed infants had a significantly higher median UIC than formula-fed infants. The BMIC was associated with maternal UIC and maternal weight. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",Breast milk iodine concentration; Breastfed infants; Breastfeeding; Iodine status; Urinary iodine concentration,article; breast feeding; breast milk; child; cross-sectional study; female; human; infant; multiple linear regression analysis; pediatric hospital; preschool child; Thailand,Article in Press

The EBT-XD film contains the same structure as the EBT3 film but has a slightly different composition and a thinner active layer. This study benchmarks the EBT-XD against EBT3 film for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams, as well as for 97.4 MeV and 148.2 MeV proton beams and 15-100 kV x-rays. Dosimetric and film reading characteristics, such as post irradiation darkening, film orientation effect, lateral response artifact (LRA), film sensitivity, energy and beam quality dependency were investigated. Furthermore, quenching effects in the Bragg peak were investigated for a single proton beam energy for both film types, in addition measurements were performed in a spread-out Bragg peak. EBT-XD films showed the same characteristic on film darkening as EBT3. The effects between portrait and landscape orientation were reduced by 3.1% (in pixel value) for EBT-XD compared to EBT3 at a dose of 2000 cGy. The LRA is reduced for EBT-XD films for all investigated dose ranges. The sensitivity of EBT-XD films is superior to EBT3 for doses higher than 500 cGy. In addition, EBT-XD showed a similar dosimetric response for photon and proton irradiation with low energy and beam quality dependency. A quenching effect of 10% was found for both film types. The slight decrease in the thickness of the active layer and different composition configuration of EBT-XD resulted in a reduced film orientation effect and LRA, as well as a sensitivity increase in high-dose regions for both photon and proton beams. Overall, the EBT-XD film improved regarding film reading characteristics and showed advantages in the high-dose region for photon and proton beams. © 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",2D dosimetry; EBT-XD; EBT3; proton dosimetry; radiochromic films,Photons; Proton beams; Proton irradiation; Quenching; EBT-XD; EBT3; High dose radiotherapies; Proton dosimetries; Radiochromic film; Radiochromic film dosimetry; Sensitivity increase; Spread out Bragg peaks; Dosimetry,Article

Upon infection, dormant liver-stage forms, hypnozoites, linger for weeks to months and then relapse to cause recurrent blood-stage infection. Very little is known about hypnozoite biology; definitive biomarkers are lacking and in vitro platforms that support phenotypic studies are needed. Here, we recapitulate the entire liver stage of P. vivax in vitro, using a multiwell format that incorporates micropatterned primary human hepatocyte co-cultures (MPCCs). MPCCs feature key aspects of P. vivax biology, including establishment of persistent small forms and growing schizonts, merosome release, and subsequent infection of reticulocytes. We find that the small forms exhibit previously described hallmarks of hypnozoites, and we pilot MPCCs as a tool for testing candidate anti-hypnozoite drugs. Finally, we employ a hybrid capture strategy and RNA sequencing to describe the hypnozoite transcriptome and gain insight into its biology. Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites are difficult to study due to the lack of human liver platforms. Gural et al. recapitulated the entire liver stage of P. vivax in vitro, including formation and reactivation of hypnozoites and release of merosomes.

The leaves of this tree are highly aromatic and used to flavor Thai dishes in place of the traditional water beetle Mangdana (Lethocerus indicus) for religious and cultural reasons. Total and aroma-active volatiles from both flavoring materials were compared using gas chromatography-olfactory (GC-O) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The volatiles from Thummong leaves and the Mangdana water beetle were collected and concentrated using headspace solid-phase microextraction. A total of 23 and 25 aroma-active volatiles were identified in Thummong leaves and Mangdana, respectively. The major aroma-active volatiles in Thummong leaves consisted of 7 aldehydes, 5 ketones, and 3 esters. In contrast, the aroma-active volatiles in the water beetle consisted of 11 aldehydes, 3 esters, and 2 ketones. Both had (E)-2-nonenal as the most intense aroma-active volatile. The water beetle character impact volatile (E)-2-hexenyl acetate was absent in the leaves, but its aroma character was mimicked by 11-dodecen-2-one in the leaves, which was absent in the beetle. In addition, a commercial Mangdana flavoring was examined using GC-O and GC-MS and found to contain only a single aroma-active volatile, hexyl acetate. All three flavoring sources exhibited similar aroma characteristics but were produced from profoundly different aroma-active volatiles. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",insect volatiles; plant volatiles; Thai food flavoring,Aldehydes; Chromatography; Drug products; Essential oils; Esters; Flavors; Forestry; Gas chromatography; Ketones; Mass spectrometry; Plants (botany); Commercial products; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometries (GC-MS); Head-space solid-phase microextraction; insect volatiles; Plant volatiles; Southern Thailand; Thai food flavoring; Traditional cooking; Odors; flavoring agent; fragrance; volatile organic compound; animal; beetle; chemistry; comparative study; cooking; Litsea; mass fragmentography; plant leaf; taste; Thailand; Animals; Coleoptera; Cooking; Flavoring Agents; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Litsea; Odorants; Plant Leaves; Taste; Thailand; Volatile Organic Compounds,Article

By assessing genome-wide heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) occupancy, we present a comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin landscapes across different Plasmodium species, strains, and life cycle stages. Common targets of epigenetic silencing include fast-evolving multi-gene families encoding surface antigens and a small set of conserved HP1-associated genes with regulatory potential. Many P. falciparum heterochromatic genes are marked in a strain-specific manner, increasing the parasite's adaptive capacity. Whereas heterochromatin is strictly maintained during mitotic proliferation of asexual blood stage parasites, substantial heterochromatin reorganization occurs in differentiating gametocytes and appears crucial for the activation of key gametocyte-specific genes and adaptation of erythrocyte remodeling machinery. Collectively, these findings provide a catalog of heterochromatic genes and reveal conserved and specialized features of epigenetic control across the genus Plasmodium. Fraschka, Filarsky et al. performed a genome-wide characterization of heterochromatin organization across multiple species, strains, and life cycle stages of malaria parasites. This revealed that heterochromatic gene silencing is a conserved strategy to drive clonal variation of surface antigens and to control life cycle stage transitions and cell differentiation. © 2018 The Authors",antigenic variation; epigenetics; gametocytes; gene silencing; heterochromatin; host-parasite interaction; HP1; malaria; Plasmodium; sexual differentiation,lysophospholipase; membrane antigen; adaptation; Article; differentiation; erythrocyte; gametocyte; gene activation; heterochromatin; human; nonhuman; plasmodium (life cycle stage); Plasmodium chabaudi; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium knowlesi; Plasmodium yoelii; priority journal; sexual development,Article

To understand chondrocyte behavior and improve cell expansion in monolayer culture, this study investigated the effects of morphological changes and cellular aggregation on the maintenance of chondrogenic capacity by observing the expression patterns of chondrogenic (collagen type II and aggrecan) and dedifferentiation (collagen type I) markers. Primary human chondrocytes were cultured on either a polystyrene surface (PS) or a polyamidoamine dendrimer surface with a fifth-generation (G5) dendron structure to create a one-step process of cell expansion and the maintenance of chondrogenic activities prior to the construction of cell sheets. Results: During the first two passages (P0 - P2), the relative mRNA level of collagen type II decreased in all cultures, while that of collagen type I increased. Remarkably, the level of collagen type II was higher and aggrecan was retained in the chondrocytes, forming cell aggregates and showing some round-shaped cells with less production of stress fibers on the G5 surface compared to fibroblast-like chondrocytes with abundant stress fibers on the PS surface. The numbers of P2 chondrocytes on the G5 and PS surfaces were nearly the same and sufficient for construction of chondrocyte sheets using a temperature-responsive plate. Without a supporting material during cell sheet manipulation, chondrocyte sheets spontaneously detached and exhibited a honeycomb-like structure of stress fibers. Unlike the chondrocyte sheets constructed from cells on the PS surface, the chondrocyte sheets from cells on the G5 surface had higher chondrogenic activities, as evidenced by the high expression of chondrogenic markers and the low expression of dedifferentiation markers. Conclusions: The one-step process of cell expansion and maintenance of chondrogenic activity could be obtained using the G5 surface. Human chondrocyte sheets were successfully constructed with high chondrogenic activity. These findings may lead to an alternative cultivation technique for human chondrocytes that offers high clinical potential in autologous chondrocyte implantation. © 2018 The Author(s).",Chondrocyte sheet; Dendrimer surface; Extracellular matrix formation; Human chondrocytes; Morphological change; Stress fiber formation,Body fluids; Cell culture; Cells; Collagen; Cytology; Dendrimers; Expansion; Fibers; Glycoproteins; Hydrogels; Maintenance; Molecular biology; Morphology; Tissue; Chondrocytes; Extracellular matrix formation; Human chondrocytes; Morphological changes; Stress fibers; Cell engineering; aggrecan; collagen type 1; collagen type 2; dendrimer; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; polyamidoamine; polystyrene; Article; articular cartilage; cell dedifferentiation; cell engineering; cell expansion; chondrocyte; chondrogenesis; controlled study; extracellular matrix; gene expression; human; human cell; hyaline cartilage; immobilized cell; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; monolayer culture; phenotype; polymerization; protein localization; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; signal transduction; stress fiber; tissue engineering,Article

The clinical features and abnormal laboratory test results of dengue infection are similar to those of other febrile illnesses; hence, its accurate and timely diagnosis for providing appropriate treatment is difficult. Delayed diagnosis may be associated with inappropriate treatment and higher risk of death. Early and correct diagnosis can help improve case management and optimise the use of resources such as hospital staff, beds, and intensive care equipment. The goal of this study was to develop a predictive model to characterise dengue severity based on early clinical and laboratory indicators using data mining and statistical tools. Methods: We retrieved data from a study of febrile illness in children at Angkor Hospital for Children, Cambodia. Of 1225 febrile episodes recorded, 198 patients were confirmed to have dengue. A classification and regression tree (CART) was used to construct a predictive decision tree for severe dengue, while logistic regression analysis was used to independently quantify the significance of each parameter in the decision tree. Results: A decision tree algorithm using haematocrit, Glasgow Coma Score, urine protein, creatinine, and platelet count predicted severe dengue with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 60.5%, 65% and 64.1%, respectively. Conclusions: The decision tree we describe, using five simple clinical and laboratory indicators, can be used to predict severe cases of dengue among paediatric patients on admission. This algorithm is potentially useful for guiding a patient-monitoring plan and outpatient management of fever in resource-poor settings. © 2018 The Author(s).",Cambodia; Children; Classification tree; Data mining; Dengue; Severity,creatinine; urea; adolescent; Article; Cambodia; child; classification and regression tree; clinical feature; cohort analysis; creatinine blood level; data mining; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; fever; Glasgow coma scale; hematocrit; hospital admission; human; infant; laboratory test; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; outpatient care; patient monitoring; platelet count; predictive value; preschool child; protein urine level; retrospective study; school child; sensitivity and specificity; severe dengue,Article

OBJECTIVE: To determine if a strategy that uses nebulization for clinical indication (on-demand) is noninferior to one that uses preventive (routine) nebulization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial enrolling adult patients expected to need invasive ventilation for more than 24 hours at 7 ICUs in the Netherlands. INTERVENTIONS: On-demand nebulization of acetylcysteine or salbutamol (based on strict clinical indications, n = 471) or routine nebulization of acetylcysteine with salbutamol (every 6 hours until end of invasive ventilation, n = 473). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, with a noninferiority margin for a difference between groups of -0.5 days. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, mortality rates, occurrence of pulmonary complications, and adverse events. RESULTS: Nine hundred twenty-two patients (34% women; median age, 66 (interquartile range [IQR], 54-75 years) were enrolled and completed follow-up. At 28 days, patients in the on-demand group had a median 21 (IQR, 0-26) ventilator-free days, and patients in the routine group had a median 20 (IQR, 0-26) ventilator-free days (1-sided 95% CI, -0.00003 to ∞). There was no significant difference in length of stay or mortality, or in the proportion of patients developing pulmonary complications, between the 2 groups. Adverse events (13.8% vs 29.3%; difference, -15.5% [95% CI, -20.7% to -10.3%]; P <.001) were more frequent with routine nebulization and mainly related to tachyarrhythmia (12.5% vs 25.9%; difference, -13.4% [95% CI, -18.4% to -8.4%]; P <.001) and agitation (0.2% vs 4.3%; difference, -4.1% [95% CI, -5.9% to -2.2%]; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among ICU patients receiving invasive ventilation who were expected to not be extubated within 24 hours, on-demand compared with routine nebulization of acetylcysteine with salbutamol did not result in an inferior number of ventilator-free days. On-demand nebulization may be a reasonable alternative to routine nebulization. © 2018 American Medical Association.

The outer lip of waste Turbo jourdani (Turbinidae) shells, a marine snail, was utilized as a raw material for the production of a porous calcium oxide (CaO) catalyst for biodiesel (as fatty acid methyl esters; FAME) production via transesterification of palm oil and methanol. The outer lip of the shell was calcined at 900 °C for 5 h to fully convert the shell (aragonite form of calcium carbonate) into CaO with a porous structure, as characterized and confirmed by thermogravimetric, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Three key reaction parameters: catalyst concentration, methanol: oil molar ratio and reaction time were optimized in terms of maximizing the oil to FAME conversion level. The best conditions were found to be a catalyst concentration of 10 wt%, a 3:1 methanol: oil molar ratio and a 7 h reaction time to give a >99% oil to FAME conversion level. Evaluation of the reusability of the catalyst revealed that its efficiency decreased with each sequential use but that a >90% conversion level was still obtained after eight sequential uses before it then declined markedly. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Biodiesel; Solid catalyst; Transesterification; Waste shell,Animals; Biodiesel; Calcination; Calcium; Calcium carbonate; Calcium compounds; Fatty acids; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Methanol; Molluscs; Palm oil; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Shells (structures); Transesterification; Waste treatment; X ray diffraction; Biodiesel production; Catalyst concentration; Fatty acid methyl ester; Its efficiencies; Porous structures; Scanning electrons; Solid catalysts; Thermo-gravimetric; Catalysts,Article

TiO2 was initially added to the AR phase in AR/PMMA blends. The impact strength of PMMA improved with AR loading. The addition of TiO2 appeared to decrease the tensile properties of the blends with AR of 10-30 wt% of AR, but increased with AR of 40-50 wt%, this being related to distribution level of TiO2.

Unlike other recently reported CMOS biquads with passband gains that are attenuated by the bulk effect, this biquad attains a near 0-dB passband gain without gain compensation. It acquires the same levels of input and output common-mode voltages making it useful for cascade realization of a higher order lowpass filter. To demonstrate the potential application of the proposed biquad, a fourth-order lowpass filter was designed based on the proposed biquad circuit and fabricated in the 0.35-&#x03BC;m CMOS process to serve electrocardiography readout systems. Measurement results show that the filter consumes 4.26-nW static power from a 0.9-V supply providing a 100-Hz cutoff frequency. The prototype chip occupies a silicon area of 0.11 mm&#x00B2; and contributes an input-referred noise of 80.5 &#x03BC;Vrms. For a 60-Hz input frequency associated with -50-dB third-order harmonic distortion, a dynamic range of 48.2 dB is achieved. The lowest power supply rejection ratio of 40 dB was obtained at 100 Hz. Compared with the previous state-of-the-art designs in the category of nanopower filters, the proposed filter consumes the least power from the lowest supply voltage.

The successful evaluation of vaccine candidates requires well-characterized animal models and a better understanding of the immune response against O. tsutsugamushi. While many animal species have been used to study host immunity and vaccine responses in scrub typhus, only limited data exists in non-human primate (NHP) models. Methodology/Principle findings: In this study we evaluated a NHP scrub typhus disease model based on intradermal inoculation of O. tsutsugamushi Karp strain in rhesus macaques (n = 7). After an intradermal inoculation with 106murine LD50of O. tsutsugamushi at the anterior thigh (n = 4) or mock inoculum (n = 3), a series of time course investigations involving hematological, biochemical, molecular and immunological assays were performed, until day 28, when tissues were collected for pathology and immunohistochemistry. In all NHPs with O. tsutsugamushi inoculation, but not with mock inoculation, the development of a classic eschar with central necrosis, regional lymphadenopathy, and elevation of body temperature was observed on days 7–21 post inoculation (pi); bacteremia was detected by qPCR on days 6–18 pi; and alteration of liver enzyme function and increase of white blood cells on day 14 pi. Immune assays demonstrated raised serum levels of soluble cell adhesion molecules, anti-O. tsutsugamushi-specific antibody responses (IgM and IgG) and pathogen-specific cell-mediated immune responses in inoculated macaques. The qPCR assays detected O. tsutsugamushi in eschar, spleen, draining and non-draining lymph nodes, and immuno-double staining demonstrated intracellular O. tsutsugamushi in antigen presenting cells of eschars and lymph nodes. Conclusions/Significance: These data show the potential of using rhesus macaques as a scrub typhus model, for evaluation of correlates of protection in both natural and vaccine induced immunity, and support the evaluation of future vaccine candidates against scrub typhus. © 2018 Public Library of Science.

Malayan krait (Bungarus candidus) venom is known to contain highly potent neurotoxins. In recent years, there have been reports on the non-neurotoxic activities of krait venom that include myotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. However, research on such non-neurotoxicity activities of Malayan krait venom is extremely limited. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the myotoxic, cytotoxic and nephrotoxic activities of B. candidus venoms from northeastern (BC-NE) and southern (BC-S) Thailand in experimentally envenomed rats. Methods: Rats were administered Malayan krait (BC-NE or BC-S) venom (50 μg/kg, i.m.) or 0.9% NaCl solution (50 μL, i.m.) into the right hind limb. The animals were sacrificed 3, 6 and 24 h after venom administration. The right gastrocnemius muscle and both kidneys were collected for histopathological analysis. Blood samples were also taken for determination of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293) was used in a cell proliferation assay to determine cytotoxic activity. Results: Administration of BC-NE or BC-S venom (50 μg/kg, i.m.) caused time-dependent myotoxicity, characterized by an elevation of CK and LDH levels. Histopathological examination of skeletal muscle displayed marked muscle necrosis and myofiber disintegration 24 h following venom administration. Both Malayan krait venoms also induced extensive renal tubular injury with glomerular and interstitial congestion in rats. BC-NE and BC-S venoms (100-0.2 μg/mL) caused concentration-dependent cytotoxicity on the HEK-293 cell line. However, BC-NE venom (IC50 = 8 ± 1 μg/mL; at 24 h incubation; n = 4) was found to be significantly more cytotoxic than BC-S venom (IC50 = 15 ± 2 μg/mL; at 24 h incubation; n = 4). In addition, the PLA2 activity of BC-NE venom was significantly higher than that of BC-S venom. Conclusions: This study found that Malayan krait venoms from both populations possess myotoxic, cytotoxic and nephrotoxic activities. These findings may aid in clinical diagnosis and treatment of envenomed patients in the future. © 2018 The Author(s).",Bungarus candidus; Kidney; Krait; Myotoxicity; Nephrotoxicity; Venom,chloride ion; creatine kinase; creatinine; lactate dehydrogenase; nitrogen; phospholipase A2; potassium ion; snake venom; sodium ion; urea; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; blood sampling; Bungarus; Bungarus candidus; cell proliferation assay; cell viability assay; chloride blood level; concentration (parameters); controlled study; creatine kinase blood level; cytotoxicity; embryo; envenomation; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; gastrocnemius muscle; geographic distribution; HEK293 cell line; histopathology; human; human cell; IC50; kidney injury; kidney tubule disorder; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; male; muscle disease; muscle necrosis; myotoxicity; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; potassium blood level; rat; skeletal muscle; sodium blood level; Thailand; toxicity; urea nitrogen blood level,Article

The catalytic activity of 3M towards the aerobic oxidation of allylic C-H bonds was explored. Prior studies on iron salen complexes modified through conventional electron-donating or withdrawing substituents found that only the most oxidizing derivatives were competent catalysts. In contrast, the 3M complexes, which are significantly less oxidizing, are both active. Mechanistic studies comparing 3M to Fe(salen) derivatives indicate that the proximal cation contributes to the overall reactivity in the rate determining step. The cationic charge also inhibits oxidative deactivation through formation of the corresponding Fe2-μ-oxo complexes, which were isolated and characterized. This study demonstrates how non-redox active Lewis acidic cations in the secondary coordination sphere can be used to modify redox catalysts in order to operate at milder potentials with a minimal impact on the reactivity, an effect that was unattainable by tuning the catalyst through traditional substituent effects on the ligand. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Chelation; Electric fields; Ligands; Positive ions; Redox reactions; Synthesis (chemical); Aerobic oxidations; Coordination sphere; Electrostatic effect; Mechanistic studies; Rate determining step; Schiff base complexes; Substituent effect; Synthesis and characterizations; Iron compounds,Article

The aim of this study was to examine the association between fruit, vegetables, pulses and nut intake and body mass index (BMI) across countries in adolescents (13-14 years) and children (6-7 years). Data from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood; 77,243 children’s parents and 201,871 adolescents was used to examine the association between dietary intake (Food Frequency Questionnaire) and BMI using general linear models, adjusting for country gross national index. Adolescents who consumed fruit, vegetables, pulses and nuts three or more times a week had a lower BMI than the never or occasional group; eating nuts three or more times a week, was associated with a BMI value of 0.274 kg/m2 lower than the never group (p &lt; 0.001). Compared to children who never or occasionally reported eating vegetables, those reporting that they ate vegetables three or more times per week had a lower BMI of -0.079 kg/m2. In this large global study, an inverse association was observed between BMI and the reported increasing intake of vegetables in 6-7 years old and fruit, vegetables, pulses and nuts in adolescents. This study supports current dietary recommendations which emphasize the consumption of vegetables, nut and pulses, although the effect sizes were small. © 2018 by the authors.

Our goal was to investigate the mechanism of this effect, noting that low LDL levels are also associated with increased sepsis mortality. Accordingly we tested for association between VAT/SAT, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and mortality. Then we examined the effect of statin treatment, which decreases LDL production, and the effect of PCSK9 genotype, which increases LDL clearance. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients with sepsis from a tertiary care adult intensive care unit in Vancouver, Canada, who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) (n = 75) for clinical reasons. We compared LDL levels in patients with sepsis according to high versus low VAT/SAT and 90-day survival. We next examined the effects of statin therapy and PCSK9 loss-of-function genotype on survival. Results: Patients with a low VAT/SAT had increased 90-day survival and were relatively protected against low LDL levels in sepsis compared to high VAT/SAT. Statin treatment abrogated the beneficial effects of low VAT/SAT; eliminating the difference in LDL levels and survival between patients with low and high VAT/SAT. PSCK9 loss-of-function genotype similarly eliminated the increased LDL levels in low VAT/SAT patients but, in contrast, increased the survival advantage of low VAT/SAT compared to high VAT/SAT. Conclusions: Low LDL levels per se are not simply associated with decreased sepsis survival because lowering LDL levels by inhibiting LDL production (statin treatment) is associated with adverse outcomes, while increased LDL clearance (PCSK9 loss-of-function genotype) is associated with improved outcomes in patients with low VAT/SAT. © 2018 The Author(s).",LDL-cholesterol; PCSK9 genotype; Sepsis; Visceral abdominal fat,lipopolysaccharide; low density lipoprotein; proprotein convertase 9; statin (protein); abdominal subcutaneous fat; adult; adverse outcome; aged; Article; Canada; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; female; genotype; human; human tissue; intensive care unit; intra-abdominal fat; lipoprotein synthesis; loss of function mutation; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; major clinical study; male; mortality; PCSK9 gene; priority journal; retrospective study; sepsis; survival analysis,Article

A total of 468 adolescents in Surat Thani Province were selected using simple random sampling. Self-administered questionnaires were used, and multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors related to the KJC consumption. The findings suggest that the prevalence of KJC use was high (31.4%), while self-efficacy (AOR = 12.95, 95% CI = 1.64–102.35), attitude toward KJC (AOR = 30.14, 95% CI = 6.91–131.53), self-regulation (AOR = 23.80, 95% CI = 3.11–182.28), and existence of peers drinking KJC (AOR = 32.46, 95% CI = 4.86–216.58) were strongly associated with KJC drinking behavior of youth. Youth who drink alcohol (AOR = 5.23, 95% CI = 1.07–25.63), who are employed and have an income (AOR = 4.02, 95% CI = 1.07–15.13) were more likely to drink KJC. Increasing self-efficacy and developing better self-regulation skills to resist the urge to drink KJC in high-risk situations, formulating correct attitudes against drug use, and increasing surveillance of illegal drug use may drive down harmful drug use among youth. In addition, as friends influence KJC consumption, peer education can be used as a KJC consumption prevention strategy. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Kratom juice cocktail (KJC); psycho-social determinants; youth,illicit drug; kratom juice cocktail; unclassified drug; adult; Article; autoregulation; conceptual framework; demography; employment; environmental factor; female; human; income; male; Mitragyna; Mitragyna speciosa; multivariate logistic regression analysis; peer group; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; Social Cognitive Theory; social learning; social psychology; substance abuse; Thailand,Article

These structures have applications in various nanoscale devices and the joining of these structures may lead to further new configurations with more remarkable properties and applications. The join profile between different carbon nanostructures in a symmetric configuration may be modelled using the calculus of variations. In previous studies, carbon nanostructures were assumed to deform according to perfect elasticity, thus the elastic energy, depending only on the axial curvature, was used to determine the join profile consisting of a finite number of discrete bonds. However, one could argue that the relevant energy should also involve the rotational curvature, especially when its size is comparable to the axial curvature. In this paper, we use the Willmore energy, a natural generalisation of the elastic energy that depends on both the axial and rotational curvatures. Catenoids are absolute minimisers of this energy and pieces of these may be used to join various nanostructures.

This study assessed the impact of rotavirus diarrhea on HRQoL of children and their caregivers. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study among 460 hospitalized children with diarrhea aged under 5 years and their family caregivers at three hospitals in Phetchabun province, Thailand during May 2013 and February 2014. The severity of diarrhea was assessed using the Vesikari severity scoring system while the HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-3L. Results: The mean EQ-5D utility of children with all-causes diarrhea was 0.604. The utility of the rotavirus diarrhea group was significantly lower than that of the non-rotavirus diarrhea group (0.593 vs. 0.612; p-value = 0.040). The family caregiver’s utility was 0.964 at baseline and significantly decreased to 0.620 (p-value = 0.041) when their children were hospitalized with diarrhea. In multiple regression analyses, severity but not rotavirus infection had significant negative impacts on the utility of both the children and their caregivers. Conclusion: Diarrhea, either caused by rotavirus or non-rotavirus infection, resulted in substantial negative impacts on the quality of life of both the children and their caregivers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",caregiver; child; diarrhea; quality of life; Rotavirus; utility,"caregiver; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; diarrhea; female; hospitalization; human; infant; male; multicenter study; preschool child; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; regression analysis; Rotavirus infection; severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; Thailand; virology; Caregivers; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diarrhea; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Male; Quality of Life; Regression Analysis; Rotavirus Infections; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thailand",Article

Understanding the relationship between G6PD genotype and the phenotypic expression of the enzyme deficiency is necessary so that severe haemolysis can be avoided. The patterns of oxidative haemolysis have been well described in G6PD deficient hemizygous males and homozygous females; and haemolysis in the proportionally more numerous heterozygous females has been documented mainly following consumption of fava beans and more recently dapsone. It has long been known that 8-aminoquinolines, notably primaquine and tafenoquine, cause acute haemolysis in G6PD deficiency. To support wider use of primaquine in Plasmodium vivax elimination, more data are needed on the haemolytic consequences of 8-aminoquinolines in G6PD heterozygous females. Two recent studies (in 2017) have provided precisely such data; and the need has emerged for the development of point of care quantitative testing of G6PD activity. Another priority is exploring alternative 8-aminoquinoline dosing regimens that are practical and improve safety in G6PD deficient individuals. © 2018 The Author(s).",8-aminoquinoline; G6PD deficiency; G6PD heterozygous female; Haemolysis; Malaria; Plasmodium vivax; Primaquine; Radical cure,8 aminoquinoline derivative; chlorproguanil plus dapsone; ciprofloxacin; dapsone; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; nalidixic acid; nitrofurantoin; primaquine; rasburicase; tafenoquine; blood transfusion; dose response; drug dose comparison; drug megadose; erythrocyte; favism; female; fluorescence analysis; genotype; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; hemolysis; hemolytic anemia; heterozygote; human; mosaicism; phenotype; Plasmodium vivax malaria; point of care testing; Review; somatic cell,Review

However, there is still no widely accepted standardized sincerity of effort test. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether grip strength test in three wrist positions could distinguish between maximal and submaximal efforts. Methods: Twenty healthy individuals (10 men and 10 women) with a mean age of 26.7 ± 3.92 years participated in this study. All participants completed two test conditions (maximal and submaximal efforts) in three wrist positions (neutral, flexion, and extension) using both hands. Each participant exerted 100% effort in the maximal effort condition and 50% effort in the submaximal effort condition. The participants performed three repetitions of the grip strength test for each session. Results: The results showed that there is a significant main effect of the type of effort (p < 0.001), wrist position (p < 0.001), and hand (p = 0.028). There were also significant types of effort and wrist position interactions (p < 0.001) and effort and hand interactions (p < 0.028). The results also showed that grip strength was highest at the wrist in neutral position in both the maximal and the submaximal effort condition. Grip strength values of the three wrist positions in the maximal effort condition were noticeably greater than those in the submaximal effort condition. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that grip strength test in three wrist positions can differentiate a maximal effort from a submaximal effort. Thus, this test could potentially be used to detect sincerity of effort in clinical setting. © 2017 The Authors",grip strength; maximal effort; sincerity of effort; submaximal effort; wrist position,adult; clinical article; female; grip strength test; human; male; normal human; wrist,Article

In this study, wheat bran and soybean were used as substrate for seed koji cultivation and koji fermentation respectively. Enzyme activities in seed koji were far lower than that of koji. This was due to limited growth of koji molds in seed koji. However, correlation between these proteases and soluble protein release in koji was found. Moreover, pectinase also showed correlation with soluble protein release in koji. The results indicated that protease and pectinase activities were crucial for protein digestion. Lack of one of these enzymes led to low protein digestion ability of koji mold. Selection of koji starter culture would be more precise if pectinase as macerating enzyme was considered during the koji fermentation.

Methods: OA was induced in the knee joints of male Wistar rats using transection of the ACL or induction of osteochondral injury. Changes in the percentage of high limb weight distribution (%HLWD) on the operated hind limb were used to determine the pain behaviour in these models. The development of OA was assessed and compared using a histological evaluation based on the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) cartilage OA histopathology score. Results: Both models showed an increase in joint pain as indicated by a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the values of %HLWD at one week post-surgery. In the osteochondral injury model, the %HLWD returned to normal within three weeks, while in the ACLT model, a significant decrease in the %HLWD was persistent over an eight-week period. In addition, OA progression was more advanced in the ACLT model than in the osteochondral injury model. Furthermore, the ACLT model exhibited a higher mean OA score than that of the osteochondral injury model at 12 weeks. Conclusion: The development of pain patterns in the ACLT and osteochondral injury models is different in that the OA progression was significant in the ACLT model. Although both can be used as models for a post-traumatic injury of the knee, the selection of appropriate models for OA in preclinical studies should be specified and relevant to the clinical scenario. © 2018 Author(s) et al.",Anterior cruciate ligament transection; Osteoarthritis progression; Osteochondral injury; Pain; Surgically induced osteoarthritis model,animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anterior cruciate ligament transection; arthralgia; Article; articular cartilage; cartilage injury; chondrocyte; controlled study; disease exacerbation; disease severity; fibrocartilage; hindlimb; histopathology; ligament injury; male; nonhuman; osteoarthritis; osteochondral injury; rat; weight,Article

Here we report that the human FBP1 gene is regulated by two liver-enriched transcription factors, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. C/EBPα regulates transcription of FBP1 gene via binding to the two overlapping C/EBPα sites located at nucleotide -228/-208 while HNF4α regulates FBP1 gene through binding to the classical H4-SBM site and direct repeat 3 (DR3) located at nucleotides -566/-554 and -212/-198, respectively. Mutations of these transcription factor binding sites result in marked decrease of C/EBPα- or HNF4α-mediated transcription activation of FBP1 promoter-luciferase reporter expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of -228/-208 C/EBPα or -566/-554 and -212/-198 HNF4α sites with nuclear extract of HepG2 cells overexpressing C/EBPα or HNF4α confirms binding of these two transcription factors to these sites. Finally, we showed that siRNA-mediated suppression of C/EBPα or HNF4α expression in HepG2 cells lowers expression of FBP1 in parallel with down-regulation of expression of other gluconeogenic enzymes. Our results suggest that an overall gluconeogenic program is regulated by these two transcription factors, enabling transcription to occur in a liver-specific manner.

Each scan was rated using ASPECTS by senior radiology resident, neuroradiology fellow, and later by consensus between two expert raters. Statistical analysis included determination of Cohen’s kappa (κ) coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS A total of 43 patients met our study criteria. Interobserver agreements for ASPECTS varied from 0.486 to 0.678 in Cohen’s κ coefficient between consensus of two neuroradiologists and a neuroradiology fellow, and from 0.198 to 0.491 for consensus between two neuroradiologists and a senior radiology resident. ICC among three raters (expert consensus, neuroradiology fellow, and senior radiology resident), was very good when 8 HU window width and 32 HU center level setting was used. CONCLUSION ASPECTS varied among raters. However, when using a narrowed window setting for interpretation, interobserver agreement improved. © Turkish Society of Radiology 2018.",,adult; alberta stroke program early computed tomography score; aphasia; Article; brain infarction; brain ischemia; cerebral artery disease; clinical article; computed tomographic angiography; consensus; edema; emergency ward; female; hemiparesis; human; internal consistency; male; medical expert; middle aged; nerve cell; neuroradiologist; neuroradiology; reliability; retrospective study; scoring system; statistical analysis; vertebra body,Article

In this report, we presented DNA typing protocol to investigate many skeletal remains in different degrees of decomposing. In addition, we established the grading system aiming for prior determination of the association between levels of decomposing and overall STR amplification efficacy. A total of 80 bone samples were subjected to DNA isolation using the modified DNA IQ™ System (Promega, USA) for bone extraction following with STR analysis using the AmpFLSTR Identifiler® (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). In low destruction group, complete STR profiles were observed as 84.4% whereas partial profiles and non-amplified were found as 9.4% and 6.2%, respectively. Moreover, in medium destruction group, both complete and partial STR profiles were observed as 31.2% while 37.5% of this group was unable to amplify. Nevertheless, we could not purify DNA and were unable to generate STR profile in any sample from the high destroyed bone samples. Compact bones such as femur and humerus have high successful amplification rate superior than loose/spongy bones. Furthermore, costal cartilage could be a designate specimen for DNA isolation in a case of the body that was discovered approximately to 3 days after death which enabled to isolate high quality and quantity of DNA, reduce time and cost, and do not require special tools such as freezer mill. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bone remain; Degraded DNA; DNA typing; Forensic genetics,genomic DNA; Article; controlled study; decomposition; DNA extraction; DNA fingerprinting; DNA isolation; femur; forensic genetics; forensic identification; gene amplification; genetic analysis; human; human tissue; humerus; priority journal; rib cartilage; skeleton,Article

One-dimensional consolidation tests and consolidated-undrained triaxial compression tests on three soils of similar base clay but with different silt contents were performed. The undrained triaxial tests were carried out on specimens of the silt- clay soils with different overconsolidation ratios. It was observed that the tested silt-clay soils were less compressible when consolidated in the vertical direction as the silt content increased. During triaxial shear, the silt-clay soils exhibited stiffer stress- strain response with increasing silt content. The pore pressure changes increased with the amount of non-plastic silt in the soils, particularly at low overconsolidation ratio (OCR). The undrained shear strengths and effective friction angles significantly increased with the amount of silt.

However, the potential productivity of this system can be limited. In this study, the Escherichia coli chaperones (GroES–GroEL) were expressed from the PGAP promoter and targeted to the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ability of the ER targeted chaperones to improve production of bacterial protein in P. pastoris was evaluated. The chaperones tagged with α-factor secretion- and ER retention-signal sequences were co-expressed with either extracellularly secreted phytase or intracellular D-phenylglycine aminotransferase (D-PhgAT) enzymes. The ER residing GroEL–GroES successfully increased the levels of active phytase extracellularly, 1.5–2.3-fold higher than the phytase expression alone, but did not enhance the formation of active, intracellular D-PhgAT. These results indicate that the chaperones have the potential to enhance production of active enzymes when present in the same trafficking pathway. This is the first report on the improvement of extracellular bacterial protein production through co-expression with ER residing bacterial chaperones in the Pichia system.

Plant phenolics exert diverse bioactivities i.e., antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Herein, phenolic compounds, namely protocatechuic aldehyde (PCA) constituents of Hydnophytum formicarum Jack. including vanillic acid (VA) and trans-ferulic acid (FA) found in Spilanthes acmella Murr., were explored for anti-neurodegenerative properties using an in vitro model of oxidative stress-induced neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Exposure of the neuronal cells with H2O2 resulted in the decrease of cell viability, but increasing in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) together with morphological changes and inducing cellular apoptosis. SH-SY5Y cells pretreated with 5 µM of PCA, VA, and FA were able to attenuate cell death caused by H2O2-induced toxicity, as well as decreased ROS level and apoptotic cells after 24 h of treatment. Pretreated SH-SY5Y cells with phenolic compounds also helped to upregulate H2O2-induced depletion of the expressions of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and forkhead box O (FoxO) 3a as well as induce the levels of antioxidant (superoxide dismutase (SOD) 2 and catalase) and antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins.

Lumbosacral selective nerve root block (SNRB) via a transforaminal approach is commonly performed under fluoroscopic guidance. However, ultrasound guidance is an alternative to overcome the radiologic disadvantages. This study examined the accuracy of needle-tip localization under ultrasound guidance with a contrast bubble, compared with fluoroscopic guidance. Objective: The primary objectives were to envisage the needle-tip localization with an air bubble by ultrasound and also to determine the accuracy of needle-tip location in transforaminal lumbar SNRB for low back and leg pain patients who were not surgical candidates. Methods: A prospective study of 30 SNRBs was conducted. An air bubble was produced and was used to envisage the needle-tip location under ultrasound guidance. Finally, the needle tip was confirmed by fluoroscopy. The accuracy of needle-tip location was statistically analyzed. Results: Twenty-four SNRBs were performed at L4–5 and 6 SNRBs at L3–4. The accuracy of needle-tip localization was 80%. Conclusion: In order to avoid radiation exposure during the SNRB procedure, ultrasound guidance might be an alternative. Despite being accepted practice, there is a steep learning curve involved in the use of ultrasound guidance for lumbar SNRB, and proper training is crucial.

Operative procedures near those areas, especially at the first metatarsocuneiform joint, may disturb tendon insertions and cause irritation or functional impairment of the tendon. Methods: Tibialis anterior tendons and their insertion sites were dissected and examined from 46 cadaveric feet (19 female and 27 male cadavers, aged between 33 and 86 years, with a mean of 68.5 ± 14.3 years). The greatest lengths and widths of the tendon attachments on the bony surface of the medial cuneiform and base of the first metatarsal, on both the medial and plantar surfaces, were measured and analyzed. The measurement reliability was evaluated by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: Most of the tibialis anterior tendon insertions were found to be longer at the medial cuneiform than at the base of the first metatarsal (mean, 8.3 and 5.4 mm; P <.001), but the widths were almost similar (mean, 11.0 and 10.4 mm; P =.079). When focusing on each bone, the widths of the tendon attachments on the medial and plantar surfaces of the medial cuneiform were equivalent (mean, 5.4 and 5.6 mm; P =.584). At the base of the first metatarsal, the tendon attachment on the plantar surface was found to be wider than on the medial surface (mean, 7.0 and 3.4 mm; P <.001). Conclusion: The widths of the tibialis anterior tendon insertions on the medial and plantar surfaces of the medial cuneiform were equal, as were the total widths of insertions on the medial cuneiform and on the base of the first metatarsal. However, the width of insertions on the medial surface of the first metatarsal was significantly smaller than on the plantar surface, and the total length of insertions at the medial cuneiform was longer than at the first metatarsal. Clinical Relevance: This study provides information about characteristics of the tibialis anterior tendon insertions, particularly details of the dimensions on each surface of the bones. This knowledge enables surgeons to minimize the risk of irritation or tendon injuries during operations near the base of the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform area. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.",cadaveric study; first metatarsal; foot surgery; medial cuneiform; tibialis anterior tendon,Article; cuneiform bone; female; human; human tissue; male; priority journal; tendon; tibial artery,Article

We have shown that nitrite inhibits platelet activation and increases platelet cGMP levels in the presence of partially deoxygenated erythrocytes. In this study, we investigated the effect of nitrite on phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein on residue serine 239 (P-VASPSer239), a marker of protein kinase G (PKG) activation, in human platelets. In platelet-rich plasma (PRP), nitrite itself had no effect on levels of P-VASPSer239 while DEANONOate increased P-VASPSer239. Deoxygenation of PRP + erythrocytes (20% hematocrit) raised baseline P-VASPSer239 in platelets. At 20% hematocrit, nitrite (10 μM) increased P-VASPSer239 in platelets about 31% at 10–20 minutes of incubation while the levels of P-VASPSer157, a marker of protein kinase A (PKA) activation, were not changed. Nitrite increased P-VASPSer239 in platelets in the presence of deoxygenated erythrocytes at 20–40% hematocrit, but the effects were slightly greater at 20% hematocrit. In conclusion, our data confirm that nitrite increases P-VASPSer239 in platelets in the presence of deoxygenated erythrocytes. They also further support the idea that partially deoxygenated erythrocytes may modulate platelet activity, at least in part, via the NO/sGC/PKG pathway from NO formed by reduction of circulating nitrite ions.

Co-inheritance of both disorders may affect red blood cell pathology to a greater extent than normally seen in either disorder alone. This study determines the prevalence and evaluates hematological changes of G-6-PD deficiency and thalassemia co-inheritance. Methods: G-6-PD deficiency was screened from 200 male thalassemia blood samples using a fluorescent spot test. Hematological parameters and red blood cell morphology were evaluated among G-6-PD deficiency/thalassemia co-inheritance, G-6-PD deficiency alone, thalassemia alone, and normal individuals. Results: G-6-PD deficiency was detected together with hemoglobin (Hb) E heterozygote, Hb E homozygote, β-thalassemia trait, and β-thalassemia/Hb E, α-thalassemia-2 trait, and Hb H disease. Hb level, hematocrit, mean cell volume, and mean cell Hb of G-6-PD deficiency co-inherited with asymptomatic thalassemia carriers show significantly lower mean values compared to carriers with only the same thalassemia genotypes. Higher mean red blood cell distribution width was observed in G-6-PD deficiency co-inherited with Hb E heterozygote, as with numbers of hemighost cells in G-6-PD deficiency/thalassemia co-inheritance compared to those with either disorder. Apart from Hb level, hematological parameters of co-inheritance disorders were not different from individuals with a single thalassemia disease. Conclusion: G-6-PD deficiency co-inherited with thalassemia in males was present in 10% of the participants, resulting in worsening of red blood cell pathology compared with inheritance of thalassemia alone. © 2017 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre",G-6-PD deficiency; Red blood cell morphology; Red blood cell parameters; Thalassemia,hemoglobin E; alpha thalassemia; Article; beta thalassemia; blood sampling; cell volume; cellular distribution; controlled study; erythrocyte structure; genotype; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; hematocrit; hematological parameters; hemoglobin E-beta thalassemia; heterozygote; homozygote; human; human cell; major clinical study; male; pathology; pathophysiology; prevalence; thalassemia,Article

Methods: Fifty children and adolescents with β-thalassemia/HbE disease were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Hemoglobin, serum ferritin and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed prior to, and one week after blood transfusion. Insulin sensitivity indices [homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), whole body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI)] and β-cell function indices [HOMA of β-cell function (HOMA-β), insulinogenic index (IGI), and disposition index (DI)] were calculated from glucose and insulin levels obtained during the OGTT. Results: Following blood transfusion, hemoglobin and serum ferritin increased significantly; 8.5 to 10.1 g/dL (p<0.001) and 1764 to 2160 ng/mL (p<0.001), respectively. β-Cell function indices also increased significantly [median HOMA-β: 74.3 vs. 82.7 (p=0.033); median IGI: 59.6 vs. 79.3 (p=0.003); median DI: 658 vs. 794 (p=0.01)]. However, the insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) tended to decrease and the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) tended to increase although this did not reach significance. Multivariate analysis showed that pre-transfusion serum ferritin was the major factor negatively associated with WBISI and positively associated with HOMA-IR, but pre-transfusion hemoglobin had no significant association with insulin sensitivity indices post-transfusion. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that acute increases in serum ferritin and hemoglobin following blood transfusion in patients with thalassemia might contribute to an increase in insulin secretion and to a trend towards increased insulin resistance. © 2018 by Turkish Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Society.",Ferritin; Hemochromatosis; Hemoglobinopathy; Insulin resistance; Iron,deferiprone; ferritin; glucose; hemoglobin; iron; adolescent; anemia; area under the curve; Article; beta thalassemia; blood transfusion; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; correlation analysis; female; hematocrit; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin release; insulin sensitivity; male; oral glucose tolerance test; pancreas islet cell function; prospective study; school child; short stature; underweight,Article

Due to X-chromosome inactivation, females heterozygous for G6PD with 1 allele encoding a G6PD-deficient protein and the other a normal protein produce 2 RBC populations each expressing exclusively 1 allele. The G6PD mosaic is not captured with routine G6PD tests. Methods: An open-source software tool for G6PD cytofluorometric data interpretation is described. The tool interprets data in terms of % bright RBC, or cells with normal G6PD activity in specimens collected from 2 geographically and ethnically distinct populations, an African American cohort (USA) and a Karen and Burman ethnic cohort (Thailand) comprising 242 specimens including 89 heterozygous females. Results: The tool allowed comparison of data across 2 laboratories and both populations. Hemizygous normal or deficient males and homozygous normal or deficient females cluster at narrow % bright cells with mean values of 96%, or 6% (males) and 97%, or 2% (females), respectively. Heterozygous females show a distribution of 10-85% bright cells and a mean of 50%. The distributions are associated with the severity of the G6PD mutation. Conclusions: Consistent cytofluorometric G6PD analysis facilitates interlaboratory comparison of cellular G6PD profiles and contributes to understanding primaquine-associated hemolytic risk. © 2017 The Authors.

However, muscle biopsy is an expensive, invasive, time-consuming, and resource-dependent procedure. The need for general anesthesia in children also increases the risks associated with this procedure. The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits of muscle biopsies performed over a 10-year period, with a focus on indications, suspected and histopathologic diagnosis, and impact on diagnosis and management decisions. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed results of muscle biopsies performed in children at our center during the 2004 to 2014 study period. Clinical presentations, biopsy complications, pathologic results, and changes in management decision were reviewed and analyzed. Results: Biopsies from 92 patients were included. Mean age of patients was 7.1 years, and 66.3% were male. There were no perioperative complications, and definitive diagnosis was made in 74 patients. Regardless of whether pathologic changes were found or not, information gained from muscle biopsy significantly impacted prognosis and subsequent genetic counseling. Conclusions: Muscle biopsy is a safe and useful diagnostic tool in children suspected of having neuromuscular diseases, especially in those with muscle diseases.

There are usually higher incident rates of RTI in Thailand over long holidays such as New Year and Songkran. To our knowledge, there have been no studies that describe the impact of emergency medical service (EMS) utilization by RTI patients in Thailand. We sought to determine the outcomes of EMS utilization in severe RTIs during the holidays. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review study by using a nationwide registry that collected RTI data from all hospitals in Thailand during the New Year holidays in 2008-2015 and Songkran holidays in 2008-2014. A severe RTI patient was defined as one who was admitted, transferred to another hospital, or who died at the emergency department (ED) or during referral. We excluded patients who died at the scene, those who were not transported to the ED, and those who were discharged from the ED. Outcomes associated with EMS utilization were identified by using multiple logistic regression and adjusted by using factors related to injury severity. Results: Overall we included 100, 905 patients in the final analysis; 39, 761 severe RTI patients (39.40%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 95% CI [39.10%-39.71%]) used EMS transportation to hospitals. Severe RTI patients transported by EMS had a significantly higher mortality rate in the ED and during referral than that those who were not (2.00% vs. 0.78%, p < 0.001). Moreover, EMS use was significantly associated with increased mortality rate in the first 24 hours of admission to hospitals (1.38% for EMS use vs. 0.57% for no EMS use, p < 0.001). EMS utilization was a significant predictor of mortality in EDs and during referral (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.19; 95% CI [1.88-2.55]), and mortality in the first 24 hours of admission (adjusted OR 2.31; 95% CI [1.95-2.73]). Conclusion: In this cohort, severe RTI patients transported by EMS had a significantly higher mortality rate than those who went to hospitals using private vehicles during these holidays. © 2018 Riyapan et al.",,adolescent; adult; Article; clinical outcome; confidence interval; controlled study; emergency health service; emergency ward; female; health care utilization; hospital admission; human; incidence; infant; injury; injury severity; leisure; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; odds ratio; patient referral; patient transport; retrospective study; road traffic injury; Thailand; traffic accident,Article

Down-regulation or heterozygous mutations of Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1) is associated with elevated HbF levels in non-thalassemia subjects. This study confirms that experimental down-regulation of KLF1 in β0-thalassemia/HbE-derived erythroblasts significantly increases HbF production (up to 52.3 ± 2.4%), albeit with slightly delayed erythroid terminal differentiation. KLF1 exome sequencing of 130 Thai β0-thalassemia/HbE patients without co-inheritance of α-thalassemia found six patients with KLF1 heterozygous mutations including rs2072596 (p.F182L; n = 5) and rs745347362 (p.P284L; n = 1) missense mutations.

Interventions are required to reduce antimicrobial overuse in these common infections. Methods During a 9-month study period (June 2014–February 2015), a quasi-experimental (pre-/post-) study was conducted among internal medicine residents and fellows in an outpatient setting of Siriraj Hospital, Thailand. The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of individual feedback to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions for treating URIs. The administrative ICD-10 database was used to identify index physicians with at least one outpatient experience of URI. Data on antimicrobial prescriptions were extracted from the hospital pharmacy database. A confidential letter and SMS were sent to all index physicians about the extent of antimicrobial therapy they prescribed for treating URIs during the pre-intervention period. Results The proportion of antimicrobial use among the index encounters showed a significant reduction from 34.7% in the pre-intervention period to 26.1% in the post-intervention period (P = 0.02). Segmented logistic regression analysis confirmed the significant impact of the intervention on reducing antimicrobial prescriptions (P = 0.02). Conclusion This integrated intervention is simple and non-labour intensive and may therefore be used sustainably in resource-limited settings. © 2017 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer",Antimicrobial agents; Antimicrobial stewardship program; Inappropriate prescription; Upper respiratory infection,antibiotic agent; acute disease; acute epiglottitis; acute laryngopharyngitis; acute laryngopharyngitis; acute obstructive laryngitis; acute obstructive laryngitis; acute sinusitis; acute suppurative otitis media; antibiotic therapy; Article; croup; frontal sinusitis; human; ICD-10; laryngitis; laryngotracheobronchitis; major clinical study; maxilla sinusitis; non suppurative otitis media; non suppurative otitis media; otitis media; paranasal sinusitis; pharyngitis; prescription; priority journal; quasi experimental study; rhinopharyngitis; serous otitis media; sinusitis; streptococcal pharyngitis; suppurative otitis media; tonsillitis; tracheitis; university hospital; upper respiratory tract infection; virus infection,Article

A simpler alternative is to inject local anaesthetic inside the posteromedial quadrant of the psoas muscle under ultrasound guidance. OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that both techniques would result in similar total anaesthesia time, defined as the sum of performance and onset time. DESIGN A randomised, observer-blinded, equivalence trial. SETTING Ramathibodi Hospital and Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital (Thailand) from12May 2016 to 10 January 2017. PATIENTS A total of 110 patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty, who required lumbar plexus block for postoperative analgesia. INTERVENTION In the combined ultrasonography-neurostimulation group, quadriceps-evoked motor response was sought at a current between 0.2 and 0.8mA prior to local anaesthetic injection (30 ml of lidocaine 1% and levobupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 5μgml-1 and 5mg of dexamethasone). In the ultrasound guidance alone group, local anaesthetic was simply injected inside the posteromedial quadrant of the psoas muscle. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES We measured the total anaesthesia time, the success rate (at 30 min), the number of needle passes, block-related pain, cumulative opioid consumption (at 24 h) and adverse events (vascular puncture, paraesthesia, local anaesthetic spread to the epidural space). The equivalence margin was 7.4 min. RESULTS Compared with ultrasound guidance alone, combined ultrasonography-neurostimulation resulted in decreased mean (±SD) total anaesthesia time [15.3 (±6.5) vs. 20.1 (±9.0) min; mean difference, ±4.8; 95% confidence interval,-8.1 to-1.9;P=0.005] andmean (±SD) onset time [10.2 (±5.6) vs. 15.5 (±9.0) min; P=0.004). No inter-group differences were observed in terms of success rate, performance time, number of needle passes, block-related pain, opioid consumption or adverse events. CONCLUSION Although the ultrasonography-neurostimulation technique results in a shorter total anaesthesia time compared with ultrasound guidance alone, this difference falls within our accepted equivalence margin (±7.4 min). © 2018 European Society of Anaesthesiology.

Methodology/Principal findings In this study, a novel work flow based on autofluorescence microscopy was developed to enable identification of trombiculid mites to the species level on the basis of morphological traits without any special preparation, while preserving the mite DNA for subsequent genotyping. A panel of 16 specifically selected fluorescence microscopy images of mite features from available identification keys served for complete chigger morphological identification to the species level, and was paired with corresponding genotype data. We evaluated and validated this method for paired chigger morphological and genotypic ID using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (coi) in 113 chigger specimens representing 12 species and 7 genera (Leptotrombidium, Ascoschoengastia, Gahrliepia, Walchia, Blankaartia, Schoengastia and Schoutedenichia) from the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) to the species level (complete characterization), and 153 chiggers from 5 genera (Leptotrombidium, Ascoschoengastia, Helenicula, Schoengastiella and Walchia) from Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR to the genus level. A phylogenetic tree constructed from 77 coi gene sequences (approximately 640 bp length, n = 52 new coi sequences and n = 25 downloaded from GenBank), demonstrated clear grouping of assigned morphotypes at the genus levels, although evidence of both genetic polymorphism and morphological plasticity was found. Conclusions/Significance With this new methodology, we provided the largest collection of characterized coi gene sequences for trombiculid mites to date, and almost doubled the number of available characterized coi gene sequences with a single study. The ability to provide paired phenotypic-genotypic data is of central importance for future characterization of mites and dissecting the molecular epidemiology of mites transmitting diseases like scrub typhus. © 2018 Kumlert et al.

Gadd45ß expression is dysregulated in numerous types of cancer, functioning as either a tumor promoter or a tumor suppressor. However, the functions of Gadd45ß in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), particularly in metastasis, has not been studied. The immunohistochemical analysis of Gadd45ß expression revealed that 75% of histological specimens from patients with CCA expressed high levels of Gadd45ß, and that high Gadd45ß expression was associated with metastasis. The role of Gadd45ß in CCA was examined using siRNA-mediated gene knockdown in HuCCA-1, a human CCA cell line established from a Thai patient. The effects of Gadd45ß downregulation upon cell viability and death, invasion, migration, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker expression were investigated. Gadd45ß knockdown impaired cell viability, which was associated with the induction of apoptosis. In addition, there was a marked reduction in invasion and migration, although MMP activity was unaffected. Impairment of these metastatic properties was accompanied by the decreased expression of EMT markers, including Slug, vimentin, claudin-1 and zona occludens protein 1, whereas E-cadherin expression was increased. The present study suggests that Gadd45ß is involved in regulating the viability and the metastatic potential of CCA cells, which may be mediated by the modulation of the EMT pathway. © 2018, Spandidos Publications.

We quantified seasonal and interannual changes in the fruit diet in a frugivore and important seed disperser, the white-handed gibbon, Hylobates lar, in Thailand. We used 40-d following data during April and May replicated in six consecutive years to study interannual variability in the diet and compared it with seasonal changes measured in monthly samples of the same size collected in three successive years. The 40-d periods of following also allowed us to measure the decline in dietary similarity with time over a finer scale. We measured fruit diet similarity between replicated 5-d periods using the percentage overlap (Renkonen's) index and Jaccard's similarity index. Seasonally, average dietary overlap between adjacent months was low, and similarity approached zero after four months. Average rate of decline in similarity exceeded 20 percent per 5-d period. Variation in fruit species in the diet between years was high and was correlated with interannual variation in fruiting phenology. The strongest correlation occurred in the case of Nephelium melliferum, a highly preferred species that dominated the diet in good fruiting years. It is difficult to separate changes in food species preference from changes in availability from year to year. We devised a relative measure of preference that depends on the degree to which the gibbons rely on prior knowledge to find sources. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation",food preference; gibbon diet; interannual variation; seasonal changes in diet; similarity index; Thailand,Hylobates lar; Hylobatidae; Nephelium,Article

Placement of a hydrogel spacer between the prostate and rectum has proven to reduce the volume of the rectum exposed to higher radiation dose levels in the setting of external beam radiotherapy. We present our findings with placing a rectal hydrogel spacer in patients following LDR brachytherapy, and we further assess the impact of this placement on dosimetry and acute rectal toxicity. Methods and Materials: Between January 2016 and April 2017, 74 patients had placement of a hydrogel spacer, immediately following a Pd-103 seed-implant procedure. Brachytherapy was delivered as follows: as a monotherapy to 26 (35%) patients; as part of planned combination therapy with external beam radiotherapy to 40 (54%) patients; or as a salvage monotherapy to eight (11%) patients. Postoperative MRI was used to assess separation achieved with rectal spacer. Acute toxicity was assessed retrospectively using Radiation Oncology Therapy Group radiation toxicity grading system. Rectal dosimetry was compared with a consecutive cohort of 136 patients treated with seed implantation at our institution without a spacer, using a 2-tailed paired Student's t test (p &lt; 0.05 for statistical significance). Results: On average, 11.2-mm (SD 3.3) separation was achieved between the prostate and the rectum. The resultant mean rectal volume receiving 100% of prescribed dose (V100%), dose to 1 cc of rectum (D1cc), and dose to 2 cc of rectum (D2cc) were 0 (SD 0.05 cc), 25.3% (SD 12.7), and 20.5% (SD 9.9), respectively. All rectal dosimetric parameters improved significantly for the cohort with spacer placement as compared with the nonspacer cohort. Mean prostate volume, prostate V100 and dose to 90% of gland (D90) were 29.3 cc (SD 12.4), 94.0% (SD 3.81), and 112.4% (SD 12.0), respectively. Urethral D20, D5cc, and D1cc were 122.0% (SD 17.27), 133.8% (SD 22.8), and 144.0% (SD 25.4), respectively. After completing all treatments, at the time of first the followup, 7 patients reported acute rectal toxicity—6 experiencing Grade 1 rectal discomfort and 1 (with preexisting hemorrhoids) experiencing Grade 1 bleeding. Conclusions: Injection of rectal spacer is feasible in the post-LDR brachytherapy setting and reduces dose to the rectum with minimal toxicity.

As a result, working conditions on Thai farms vary greatly, putting the health of many agricultural workers at risk. A cross-sectional study in three Thai provinces collected information on the work activities and conditions of 424 farmers representing five farm types: Rice, vegetable, flower, rice/vegetable, and flower/vegetable. The agricultural workers were mainly women (60%); their average age was 53 but ranged from 18 to 87 years. More than 64% worked more than 5 days/week. Seventy-four percent of them had only primary school education. A number of the health and hazardous working conditions surveyed were significantly different by farm type. Rice farmers were found to have the highest prevalence of allergies, nasal congestion, wheezing, and acute symptoms after pesticide use, while flower farmers had the lowest prevalence of these health outcomes. Rice farmers reported the highest prevalence of hazardous working conditions including high noise levels, working on slippery surfaces, sitting or standing on a vibrating machine, spills of chemicals/pesticides, and sharp injuries. The lowest prevalence of these working conditions (except noise) was reported by flower farmers. Vegetable farmers reported the highest prevalence knee problems, while rice farmers had the lowest prevalence. Among these farmers, more than 27 different types of pesticides were reported in use during the past year, with the majority reporting use once a month. The flower/vegetable farming group reported the highest frequency of good exposure prevention practices during pesticide use. They were the most likely to report using cotton or rubber gloves or a disposable paper masks during insecticide spraying. Those farmers who only grew vegetables had the lowest frequency of good exposure prevention practices, including use of personal protective equipment. The economic cost of work-related injuries and illnesses among informal sector agricultural workers in Thailand is unknown and in need of study. Gaps in the regulations covering pesticide sales allow farmers to purchase pesticides without adequate training in their safe use. Training targeted to farm type regarding safe pesticide use and the prevention of accidents and musculoskeletal disorders is needed. Studies of chronic health effects among Thai farmers are needed, with special emphasis on respiratory, metabolic disease and cancer. © The Author(s) 2018.",Agricultural workers; Flower farmers; Musculoskeletal disorders; Pesticides; Rice farmers; Safety; Vegetable farmers,Accident prevention; Agricultural machinery; Diseases; Food safety; Hazards; Health risks; Musculoskeletal system; Pesticides; Protective clothing; Vegetables; Agricultural workers; Cross-sectional study; Flower farmers; Musculoskeletal disorders; Personal protective equipment; Prevention of accidents; Rice farmers; Work-related Injuries; Occupational risks,Article

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), anti-asthmatic drugs with mild side effects, have anti-metastatic activity in epidermoid carcinoma, lung carcinoma, and colon cancers as well as neuroprotective effects. Herein, anti-migratory effects of two LTRAs, montelukast and zafirlukast, were investigated in glioblastoma cells. The level of CysLT1 in A172 cells was increased by 3.13 folds after IL-1β treatment. The median toxic concentration of LTRAs in A172, U373, and primary astrocytes ranged from 7.17 to 26.28 μM at 24-h post-exposure. Both LTRAs inhibited migration and invasion of glioma. Additionally, both drugs significantly inhibited the expression and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in A172 and U373 glioblastoma cells and primary human astrocytes, suggesting that CysLT1 plays a role in migration and invasion of glioma, and LTRAs are potential drugs to reduce migration and invasion. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Gelatinase; Glioma; Invasion; Migration; Montelukast; Zafirlukast,gelatinase A; gelatinase B; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; messenger RNA; montelukast; zafirlukast; zileuton; A-172 cell line; antiproliferative activity; Article; astrocyte; cell migration; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; drug effect; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; gene expression; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; TC50; tumor invasion; U373 cell line,Article

Material and methods In a national cross-sectional population-based survey in the 2015±16 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey, 12,160 women aged 18±49 years and not currently pregnant completed questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. Nutritional status was determined using Asian body mass index cut-offs: underweight (BMI&lt;18.5 kg/m2), overweight (23.0±27.4 kg/m2), and obesity (27.5 kg/m2). Multinomial logistic regression modelling was used to determine the association between socio-demographic and lifestyle factors and weight status. Results The prevalence of underweight was 14.1%, overweight 28.1% and obesity 13.1%. Among different age groups, the prevalence of underweight was the highest among 18 to 29 yearolds (20.2%), while overweight or obesity was the highest in the age group 30 to 49 years (around 50%). In multinomial logistic regression, being 30 to 49 years old, poorer and richer wealth status, living in all the other regions of Myanmar and ever contraceptive use were inversely and current tobacco use, not working and having less than two children ever born were positively associated with underweight relative to normal weight. Older age, having secondary education, urban residence, wealthier economic status, living with a partner, living in the Northern and Southern regions of Myanmar, having less than two children ever born and having ever used contraceptives were positively and current tobacco use was negatively associated with overweight or obesity relative to normal weight. Conclusions A dual burden of both underweight and overweight or obesity among female adults was found in Myanmar. Sociodemographic and health risk behaviour factors were identified for underweight and overweight or obesity that can guide public health interventions to address both of these conditions. © 2018 Hong et al.

Since the catalytic properties of CYP2R1 have been poorly studied to date and it is a membrane protein, we examined the purified enzyme in a membrane environment. CYP2R1 was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel affinity- and hydrophobic interaction-chromatography and assayed in a reconstituted membrane system comprising phospholipid vesicles plus purified human NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase. CYP2R1 converted vitamin D3 in the vesicle membrane to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] with good adherence to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The kinetic parameters for 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 by the two major vitamin D 25-hydroxylases, CYP2R1 and CYP27A1, were examined in vesicles under identical conditions. CYP2R1 displayed a slightly lower kcat than CYP27A1 but a much lower Km for vitamin D3, and thus an overall 17-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), consistent with CYP2R1 being the major vitamin D 25-hydroxylase. 20-Hydroxyvitamin D3 [20(OH)D3], the main product of vitamin D3 activation by an alternative pathway catalyzed by CYP11A1, was metabolized by CYP2R1 to 20,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [20,25(OH)2D3], with catalytic efficiency similar to that for the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3. 20,25(OH)2D3 retained full, or somewhat enhanced activity compared to the parent 20(OH)D3 for the inhibition of the proliferation of melanocytes and dermal fibroblasts, with a potency comparable to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. The 20,25(OH)2D3 was also able to act as an inverse agonist on retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α, like its parent 20(OH)D3. Thus, the major findings of this study are that CYP2R1 can metabolize substrates in a membrane environment, the enzyme displays higher catalytic efficiency than CYP27A1 for the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D, it efficiently hydroxylates 20(OH)D3 at C25 and this product retains the biological activity of the parent compound. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",25-hydroxylase; CYP2R1; Phospholipid vesicles; Vitamin D3,20 hydroxyvitamin d 3; calcifediol; calcitriol; cholestanetriol 26 monooxygenase; colecalciferol; cyp2r1 enzyme; oxidoreductase; retinoic acid; secosteroid; unclassified drug; vitamin D; Article; fibroblast; human; hydroxylation; kinetic parameters; melanocyte; membrane vesicle; Michaelis Menten kinetics; phospholipid vesicle; protein expression,Article

Aluminium, a neurotoxic metal, has been suggested as a contributing factor of AD. Caesalpinia crista is a medicinal plant known for its anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. The present study was conducted in order to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of methanolic extracts of C. crista (MECC) on aluminium-induced neurodegeneration in rats. Co-administration with MECC significantly and dose dependently ameliorated the aluminium-dependent cognitive impairment, AChE hyperactivity and oxidative stress in the hippocampus and in the frontal cortex of rat brain. Moreover, MECC reduced the neuronal injury induced by aluminium as shown by the diminution of neuron loss and pyknosis in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. From this study, it is inferred that MECC protect against aluminium-induced behavioral alterations, cognitive function, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in vivo. Therefore, this plant may serve as a source of natural products having multiple functions and could be utilized as an anti-AD preparation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Aluminium; Alzheimer's disease; Caesalpinia crista; Cognitive dysfunction; Neuroprotection,acetylcholinesterase; aluminum; Caesalpinia crista extract; natural product; plant extract; rivastigmine; unclassified drug; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; antimicrobial activity; antioxidant activity; Article; behavior disorder; Caesalpinia; Caesalpinia crista; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; degenerative disease; dose response; enzyme activity; frontal cortex; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampal CA3 region; hippocampus; in vivo study; male; nerve cell lesion; nervous system inflammation; neuroprotection; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; rat; rat model,Article

However, little is known about the bleeding risk from heparin-bridging therapy itself. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched through August 2017 for studies that compared the risk of post-ESD bleeding in patients who received heparin-bridging therapy in lieu of anticoagulant for gastric neoplasms and those who discontinued anticoagulant without receiving heparin. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Results: A total of four studies consisting of 350 patients were identified. A significantly increased risk of post-ESD bleeding among the bridged patients compared with the non-bridged patients was observed with the pooled RR of 2.99 (95% CI, 1.51 to 5.92).

Early or active arthritis is shown as bone marrow oedema, joint effusion, synovial thickening and increased joint enhancement. Subsequent joint damage includes characteristic deformity of the mandibular condyle, bone erosion, disk abnormalities and short mandibular ramus due to impaired growth. In this pictorial essay, we illustrate normal MRI findings and growth-related changes of the temporomandibular joint in children. The rationale and practical application of semiquantitative MRI assessment of joint inflammation and damage are discussed and presented. This atlas can serve as a reference for grading temporomandibular joint arthritis according to the scoring systems proposed by working groups of OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology and Clinical Trials) and the EuroTMjoint research network. Systematic assessment of the level of inflammation, degree of osteochondral deformation, and growth of the mandibular ramus by MRI may aid in monitoring the course of temporomandibular joint arthritis and evaluating treatment options. © 2017, The Author(s).",Children; Juvenile idiopathic arthritis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Synovitis; Temporomandibular joint,arthropathy; Article; articular disk; bone erosion; bone malformation; bone marrow; bone marrow edema; condylar flattening; contrast enhancement; disk abnormality; human; joint effusion; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; scoring system; synovial fluid; synovial thickening; temporal bone; temporomandibular joint,Article

With increased patient survival, the incidence of failed endoprostheses requiring revision surgery has increased. Revision of cemented endoprotheses by cementing into the existing cement mantle (CiC) is technically demanding. Methods: This is a retrospective review of our endoprosthesis database of 512 consecutive cemented endoprosthetic reconstructions performed for oncologic diagnoses between 1980 and 2014. A total of 54 implants (mean patient age 32 years, range 13-81) were revised with a CiC technique. Outcomes evaluated were prosthesis survival, revision surgery categorized according to the Henderson Failure Mode Classification, complications, and functional scores. Results: Fifteen-year Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 34% for initial revision and 39% for subsequent revision implants. Mean revised Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) Score was 27 at latest follow-up. Infection rate was 2%, 9%, and 13% for primary endoprostheses, initial revisions, and subsequent revisions, respectively. Limb salvage rate was 87%. Conclusions: At long-term follow up, endoprostheses revised with the CiC technique showed consistent 15-year survival from initial (34%) to subsequent (39%) revision. Despite a relatively high failure rate, these results are encouraging and demonstrate that this is a conservative, repeatable technique. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",cement in cement; endoprostheses; Kaplan-Meier survival; revision; sarcoma,"cement; stryker simplex p; tobramycin; bone cement; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cement in cement technique; clinical outcome; female; follow up; human; infection rate; limb salvage; long term survival; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal disease assessment; Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score; postoperative infection; priority journal; prosthesis loosening; reconstructive surgery; reoperation; retrospective study; surgical technique; survival rate; tumor growth; bone tumor; chemistry; middle aged; osteosarcoma; procedures; prosthesis complication; prosthesis implantation; reoperation; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Cements; Bone Neoplasms; Humans; Limb Salvage; Middle Aged; Osteosarcoma; Prosthesis Failure; Prosthesis Implantation; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",Article

The effect of a gelatin manipulator, as a cell sheet transfer system, on the quality of the chondrocyte sheets was investigated. The changes of important chondrogenic markers and stress fibers, resulting from the cell sheet manipulation, were also studied. The chondrocyte cell sheets were constructed with patient-derived chondrocytes using a temperature-responsive polymer and a gelatin manipulator as a transfer carrier. The properties of the cell sheets, including sizes, expression levels of collagen type II and I, and the localization of the stress fibers, were assessed and compared with those of the cell sheets harvested without the gelatin manipulator. Using the gelatin manipulator, the original size of the chondrocyte cell sheets was retained with abundant stress fibers, but with a decrease in the expression of collagen type II. Without the gelatin manipulator, although the cell shrinkage occurred, the cell sheet with suppressed stress fiber formation showed significantly higher levels of collagen type II. These results support our observations that stress fiber formation in chondrocyte cell sheets affected the production of chondrogenic markers. These densely packed tissue-like structures possessed a good chondrogenic activity, indicating their potential for use in autologous chondrocyte implantation to treat cartilage defects. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",cell sheet; chondrocytes; collagen type I; collagen type II; Human cartilage,Body fluids; Cartilage; Cells; Collagen; Cytology; Defects; Fibers; Hydrogels; Manipulators; Tissue; Cell sheet; Chondrocytes; Collagen type I; Human cartilage; Type II; Molecular biology; collagen type 1; collagen type 2; F actin; gelatin; phalloidin; polymer; adult; aged; Article; articular cartilage; cartilage biopsy; cell culture; cell density; cell shape; cell size; cellular distribution; chondrocyte; chondrocyte implantation; chondrogenesis; chondropathy; controlled study; human; human cell; human tissue; middle aged; priority journal; protein expression; RNA extraction; stress fiber; temperature sensitivity,Article

The sensor design is based on a carbon-paste electrode decorated with carbon nanotubes and gold-coated magnetite (CNTs-Fe3O4@Au/CPE) coated with a molecularly-imprinted polymer (MIP) for CBF sensing. The MIP was synthesized on the electrode surface by electropolymerization using a supramolecular complex, namely 4-ter-butylcalix [8] arene-CBF (4TB[8]A-CBF), as the template. We used o-phenylenediamine as the functional monomer. Our results demonstrate that incorporation of the MIP coating improves the electrochemical catalytic properties of the electrode, increases its surface area, and increases CBF selectivity by modulating the electrical signal through elution and re-adsorption of CBF. The imprinted sensor (MIP-CNTs-Fe3O4@Au/CPE) was used in a flow-injection analysis (FIA) system. Experimental conditions were investigated in amperometric mode, with the following optimized parameters: phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 8.0) as the carrier, flow rate 0.5 mL min−1, applied potential +0.50 V. When used in the FIA system, the designed imprinted sensor yields a linear dynamic range for CBF from 0.1 to 100 µM (r2 = 0.998) with a detection limit of 3.8 nM (3Sb), and a quantification limit of 12.7 nM (10Sb). The sensor exhibits acceptable precision (%RSD = 4.8%) and good selectivity toward CBF. We successfully applied the electrode to detect CBF in vegetable samples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Amperometry; Carbofuran sensor; Carbon-paste electrode; Flow injection; Gold-coated magnetite (Fe3O4@Au); Molecularly imprinted polymer,Amperometric sensors; Carbon nanotubes; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electropolymerization; Gold; Magnetite; Nanotubes; Plastic coatings; Polymers; Vegetables; Yarn; Amperometry; Carbofurans; Carbon paste electrode; Fe3O4-Au; Flow injection; Molecularly Imprinted Polymer; Gold coatings,Article

Two concentric circles with 1.95-mm (inner) and 3.45-mm (outer) diameters were placed manually, producing an annulus of width 0.75 mm centered at the optic disc. PCD was calculated as the ratio of pixels associated with capillaries to the pixels in the annulus after large blood vessel removal. Continuous variables were assessed by analysis of variance and Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) test. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to adjust for confounding factors.RESULTS: Forty-three XFG eyes, 31 POAG eyes matched for visual field mean deviation, 33 XFS eyes, and 45 control eyes were analyzed. PCD demonstrated a progressive decrease from controls to XFS to POAG to XFG. Pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences in PCD between each pair of groups (all P<0.01) except for PCD between XFS and POAG (P = 0.08). A multivariable model adjusting for age and stage showed a more significant decrease in PCD in XFG compared with POAG (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: PCD was more significantly decreased in XFG compared with POAG eyes and in XFS compared with control eyes.

Rheological properties, morphology, tensile, and thermal properties were investigated. All blends exhibited shear thinning behavior except for starting PLA and rPET. PLA and rPET dispersed phases appeared as droplets in as-extruded strand, and PLA droplets were mostly larger than those of rPET. The fibrillation of both PLA and rPET domains was achieved after further hot drawing as the fiber. The morphology and tensile properties of the fibers mainly depended on the types and contents of dispersed phases including draw ratios. The ultimate strength of the polymer fibers at draw ratio of 20 was more than 600 times higher than that of the as-spun sample of the same composition. Remarkable improvement in secant modulus and ultimate strength was found for PE-30PLA, but the drawing process of this composition encountered some difficulties and rough surface of the fiber was observed. The stiffness and tensile stress for PE-10PLA-10rPET fiber were clearly improved when compared with PE and PE-10PLA. A decrease in thermal stability of PE/PLA composites was observed with increasing PLA content whereas additional presence of rPET significantly increased the stability of the composites both in nitrogen and in air. PE/PLA/rPET fiber possessing high stiffness with good thermal stability prepared in this work has high potential for being utilized as structural parts for load-bearing applications.

Thirty-six VOC species were identified by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS). They were classified into six groups, including alkanes, alkenes, oxygenated VOCs, halogenated VOCs, aromatics and other. The emission factor for total VOCs was estimated as about 148 mg kg−1 dry mass burned. About 68.4% of the compounds were aromatics. Field samplings of maize residues were conducted to acquire the information of fuel characteristics including fuel loading, fraction of maize residues that were actually burned as well as proximate and elemental analysis of maize residues. The emission factors were then applied to estimate speciated VOC emissions from maize residue open burning at the provincial level in the upper-northern region of Thailand for the year 2014. Total burned area of maize covered an area of about 500,000 ha which was about 4.7% of the total area of upper-northern region of the country. It was found that total VOC emissions released during the burning season (January–April) was about 79.4 tons.

FVII deficiency is the most common of the rare congenital bleeding disorders. While the mutational pattern has been extensively characterized, the pathogenic molecular mechanisms of mutations, particularly at the intracellular level, have been poorly defined. Here, we aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying altered FVII biosynthesis in the presence of three mutation types in the catalytic domain: a missense change, a microdeletion and a frameshift/elongation, associated with severe or moderate to severe phenotypes. Using CHO-K1 cells transiently transfected with expression vectors containing the wild-type FVII cDNA (FVIIwt) or harboring the p.I289del, p.G420V or p.A354V-p.P464Hfs mutations, we found that the secretion of the FVII mutants was severely decreased compared to FVIIwt. The synthesis rate of the mutants was slower than the FVIIwt and delayed, and no degradation of the FVII mutants by proteasomes, lysosomes or cysteine proteases was observed. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed that FVII variants were localized into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but were not detectable within the Golgi apparatus. These findings suggested that a common pathogenic mechanism, possibly a defective folding of the mutant proteins, was triggered by the FVII mutations. The misfolded state led to impaired trafficking of these proteins causing ER retention, which would explain the low to very low FVII plasma levels observed in patients carrying these mutations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",ER retention; Factor VII; Factor VII deficiency; Mutations; Protein trafficking,"blood clotting factor 7; complementary DNA; mutant protein; proteasome; blood clotting factor 7; animal cell; Article; blood clotting factor 7 deficiency; CHO-K1 cell line; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum; enzyme active site; female; immunofluorescence microscopy; lysosome; molecular model; mutation; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein misfolding; protein secretion; protein transport; amino acid substitution; animal; blood clotting factor 7 deficiency; chemistry; CHO cell line; Cricetulus; enzyme active site; genetics; hamster; human; metabolism; missense mutation; molecular dynamics; protein folding; signal transduction; Amino Acid Substitution; Animals; Catalytic Domain; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Factor VII; Factor VII Deficiency; Humans; Models, Molecular; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Mutant Proteins; Mutation, Missense; Protein Folding; Protein Transport; Signal Transduction",Article

Methods: A ‘bottom-up’ PBPK model for OLZ was constructed in Simcyp® (V14.1) and validated against pharmacokinetic studies and data from therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The physiological, demographic and genetic attributes of the ‘healthy volunteer population’ file in Simcyp® were then individualized to create ‘virtual twins’ of 14 patients. The predicted systemic exposure of OLZ in virtual twins was compared with measured concentration in corresponding patients. Predicted exposures were used to calculate a hypothetical decrease in exposure variability after OLZ dose adjustment. Results: The pharmacokinetic parameters of OLZ from single-dose studies were accurately predicted in healthy Caucasians [mean-fold errors (MFEs) ranged from 0.68 to 1.14], healthy Chinese (MFEs 0.82 to 1.18) and geriatric Caucasians (MFEs 0.55 to 1.30). Cumulative frequency plots of trough OLZ concentration were comparable between the virtual population and patients in a TDM database. After creating virtual twins in Simcyp®, the R2 values for predicted vs. observed trough OLZ concentrations were 0.833 for the full cohort of 14 patients and 0.884 for the 7 patients who had additional cytochrome P450 2C8 genotyping. The variability in OLZ exposure following hypothetical dose adjustment guided by PBPK M&amp;S was twofold lower compared with a fixed-dose regimen – coefficient of variation values were 0.18 and 0.37, respectively. Conclusions: Olanzapine exposure in individual patients was predicted using PBPK M&amp;S. Repurposing of available PBPK M&amp;S platforms is an option for model-informed precision dosing and requires further study to examine clinical potential. © 2017 The British Pharmacological Society",dose prediction; olanzapine; PBPK; personalized medicine; physiologically based pharmacokinetics,cytochrome P450 2C8; olanzapine; adult; aged; Article; biliary clearance; Caucasian; Chinese; clinical article; controlled study; cumulative scale; dose response; drug absorption; drug distribution; drug elimination; drug exposure; drug metabolism; drug monitoring; excretion fraction; female; fraction absorbed; genotype; hepatic clearance; human; male; maximum plasma concentration; personalized medicine; pharmacokinetic parameters; plasma concentration-time curve; priority journal; renal clearance; simulation; single drug dose; time to maximum plasma concentration; twins; virtual reality; young adult,Article

It was shown to eliminate hybridized smear layer and nanoleakage expression in resin–dentin bonding interface of two-step self-etch adhesive. This study aimed to investigate those effects on various one-step self-etch adhesives. Methods: Four different one-step self-etch adhesives were used in this study; SE One (SE), Scotchbond™ Universal (SU), BeautiBond Multi (BB), and Bond Force (BF). Flat human dentin surfaces with standardized smear layer were prepared. Smear layer deproteinizing was carried out by the application of 50 ppm hypochlorous acid (HOCl) on dentin surface for 15 s followed by Accel® (p-toluenesulfinic acid salt) for 5 s prior to adhesive application. No surface pretreatment was used as control. Microtensile bond strength (μTBS) and nanoleakage under TEM observation were investigated. The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test and t-test at the significant level of 0.05. Results: Smear layer deproteinizing significantly improved μTBS of SE, SU, and BB (p &lt; 0.001). Hybridized smear layer observed in control groups of SE, BB, and BF, and reticular nanoleakage presented throughout the hybridized complex in control groups of BB and BF were eliminated upon the smear layer deproteinizing. Significance: Smear layer deproteinizing by HOCl and Accel® application could enhance the quality of dentin for bonding to one-step self-etch adhesives, resulting in the improving μTBS, eliminating hybridized smear layer and preventing reticular nanoleakage formation in resin–dentin bonding interface. © 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials",Hybridized smear layer; Hypochlorous acid; Microtensile bond strength; Monomer infiltration; Nanoleakage; One-step self-etch adhesive; Smear layer; Smear layer deproteinizing,Adhesives; Bond (masonry); Bond strength (materials); Resins; Hypochlorous acids; Micro-tensile bond strength; Nanoleakages; One-step self-etch adhesive; Smear layers; Chlorine compounds,Article

Methods and Results: A bacterial genome was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform. Multilocus sequence analysis confirmed that the bacterium belongs to Vibrio harveyi species. Further phylogenetic analysis inferred from core genome SNPs revealed a close relationship between our bacterium and the V. harveyi isolated from groupers in Taiwan and China. blastp results indicated that V. harveyi piscine strains carried numerous adhesin, secretion system, siderophore and toxin-related genes. Genome comparison between Y6 and 32 strains of V. harveyi from different origins showed that at least 17 potential virulence genes were present exclusively in the strain Y6. Many of these (six of 17 genes) were homologous to pyoverdine siderophore, a secreted high-affinity iron chelator, clusters originally found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genome of V. harveyi Y6 was incorporated by a bacteriophage VHY6φ and replication protein of the phage was most similar to CTXφ described previously in Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio fischeri. However, the cholera toxin-encoding genes, namely ctxA and ctxB, were absent from VHY6φ, while the CTXφ-enterotoxin gene (zonula occludens toxin; zot) remained intact. Conclusions: Several putative virulence genes and a phage carrying toxin gene were identified in the genomes of SDMN-associated V. harveyi Y6. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study confers genomic information of the piscine pathogenic V. harveyi which recently caused widespread mortality.

Differences in the management of antithrombotic agents for endoscopic procedures between Western and Eastern countries have already been reported. However, no study has investigated the differences among Asian countries. The aim of this study was to examine the differences in the etiology of gastrointestinal bleeding and management of antithrombotic agents during endoscopic procedures between Japan and other Asian countries (OAC). Methods: Questionnaires regarding gastrointestinal bleeding in clinical practice and management of antithrombotic agents during endoscopy were distributed to members of the International Gastroenterology Consensus Symposium Study Group. We analyzed the questionnaire answers and compared the results between Japan and OAC. Results: The cause of and treatment methods for gastrointestinal bleeding differed between Japan and OAC. In Japan, the trend was to continue drugs at the time of biopsy and endoscopic therapy. Even in cases of discontinuation, the drug withdrawal period was as short as <3 days. Thrombotic complications caused by the withdrawal of antithrombotic agents were observed more frequently in Japan (34.78%) than in OAC (22.46%; p = 0.016). Conclusion: Due to differences in guidelines and complications associated with discontinuation of drugs, the antithrombotic withdrawal period in Japan tended to be shorter than that in OAC. © 2018 S.

Methods: Sixty locally advanced head and neck cancer patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy concurrently with platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either benzydamine HCl or sodium bicarbonate from the first day of treatment to 2 weeks after the completion of treatment. The total score for mucositis, based on the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS), was used for the assessment, conducted weekly during the treatment period and at the fourth week of the follow-up. Pain score, all prescribed medications, and tube feeding needs were also recorded and compared. Results: The median of total OMAS score was statistically significant lower in patients who received benzydamine HCl during concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) than in those who received sodium bicarbonate, (p value < 0.001). There was no difference in median pain score, (p value = 0.52). Nineteen percent of patients in sodium bicarbonate arm needed oral antifungal agents whereas none in the benzydamine HCl arm required such medications, (p value = 0.06). Tube feeding needs and the compliance of CCRT were not different between the two study arms. Conclusions: For patients undergoing high-dose radiotherapy concurrently with platinum-based chemotherapy, using benzydamine HCl mouthwash as a preventive approach was superior to basic oral care using sodium bicarbonate mouthwash in terms of reducing the severity of oral mucositis and encouraging trend for the less need of oral antifungal drugs. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Benzydamine HCl; Concurrent chemoradiation; Mucositis; Sodium bicarbonate,benzydamine; bicarbonate; carboplatin; cisplatin; clotrimazole; morphine sulfate; nystatin; adult; advanced cancer; Article; burning sensation; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; chemoradiotherapy; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug withdrawal; female; follow up; head and neck cancer; human; major clinical study; male; mouth hygiene; multicenter study; nasopharynx cancer; nasopharynx carcinoma; oral mucositis; pain; patient compliance; priority journal; prophylaxis; randomized controlled trial; stinging sensation; treatment duration,Article

In this review, we compile archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data from East Africa to document land-cover change, and environmental, subsistence and land-use transitions, over the past 6000 years. Throughout East Africa there have been a series of relatively rapid and high-magnitude environmental shifts characterised by changing hydrological budgets during the mid- to late Holocene. For example, pronounced environmental shifts that manifested as a marked change in the rainfall amount or seasonality and subsequent hydrological budget throughout East Africa occurred around 4000, 800 and 300 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). The past 6000 years have also seen numerous shifts in human interactions with East African ecologies. From the mid-Holocene, land use has both diversified and increased exponentially, this has been associated with the arrival of new subsistence systems, crops, migrants and technologies, all giving rise to a sequence of significant phases of land-cover change. The first large-scale human influences began to occur around 4000 yr BP, associated with the introduction of domesticated livestock and the expansion of pastoral communities. The first widespread and intensive forest clearances were associated with the arrival of iron-using early farming communities around 2500 yr BP, particularly in productive and easily-cleared mid-altitudinal areas. Extensive and pervasive land-cover change has been associated with population growth, immigration and movement of people. The expansion of trading routes between the interior and the coast, starting around 1300 years ago and intensifying in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries CE, was one such process. These caravan routes possibly acted as conduits for spreading New World crops such as maize (Zea mays), tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), although the processes and timings of their introductions remains poorly documented. The introduction of southeast Asian domesticates, especially banana (Musa spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), and chicken (Gallus gallus), via transoceanic biological transfers around and across the Indian Ocean, from at least around 1300 yr BP, and potentially significantly earlier, also had profound social and ecological consequences across parts of the region. Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of information and metadatasets, we explore the different drivers and directions of changes in land-cover, and the associated environmental histories and interactions with various cultures, technologies, and subsistence strategies through time and across space in East Africa. This review suggests topics for targeted future research that focus on areas and/or time periods where our understanding of the interactions between people, the environment and land-cover change are most contentious and/or poorly resolved. The review also offers a perspective on how knowledge of regional land-use change can be used to inform and provide perspectives on contemporary issues such as climate and ecosystem change models, conservation strategies, and the achievement of nature-based solutions for development purposes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Agriculture; Archaeology; Iron technology; Land use; LandCover6k; Livelihoods; Palaeoenvironments; Pastoralism; Pottery; Savannah; Sustainable Development Goals,agriculture; archaeology; land cover; land use change; livelihood; nature-society relations; paleoenvironment; pastoralism; savanna; sustainable development; East Africa; Colocasia esculenta; Gallus gallus; Lycopersicon esculentum; Musa; Nicotiana; Nicotiana tabacum; Oryza; Zea mays,Review

In this study, we pooled data from observational pediatric HIV cohorts and cohort networks, allowing comparisons of adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV in “real-life” settings across multiple regions. We describe the geographic and temporal characteristics and mortality outcomes of APHs across multiple regions, including South America and the Caribbean, North America, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Methods and findings: Through the Collaborative Initiative for Paediatric HIV Education and Research (CIPHER), individual retrospective longitudinal data from 12 cohort networks were pooled. All children infected with HIV who entered care before age 10 years, were not known to have horizontally acquired HIV, and were followed up beyond age 10 years were included in this analysis conducted from May 2016 to January 2017. Our primary analysis describes patient and treatment characteristics of APHs at key time points, including first HIV-associated clinic visit, antiretroviral therapy (ART) start, age 10 years, and last visit, and compares these characteristics by geographic region, country income group (CIG), and birth period. Our secondary analysis describes mortality, transfer out, and lost to follow-up (LTFU) as outcomes at age 15 years, using competing risk analysis. Among the 38,187 APHs included, 51% were female, 79% were from sub-Saharan Africa and 65% lived in low-income countries. APHs from 51 countries were included (Europe: 14 countries and 3,054 APHs; North America: 1 country and 1,032 APHs; South America and the Caribbean: 4 countries and 903 APHs; South and Southeast Asia: 7 countries and 2,902 APHs; sub-Saharan Africa, 25 countries and 30,296 APHs). Observation started as early as 1982 in Europe and 1996 in sub-Saharan Africa, and continued until at least 2014 in all regions. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of adolescent follow-up was 3.1 (1.5–5.2) years for the total cohort and 6.4 (3.6–8.0) years in Europe, 3.7 (2.0–5.4) years in North America, 2.5 (1.2–4.4) years in South and Southeast Asia, 5.0 (2.7–7.5) years in South America and the Caribbean, and 2.1 (0.9–3.8) years in sub-Saharan Africa. Median (IQR) age at first visit differed substantially by region, ranging from 0.7 (0.3–2.1) years in North America to 7.1 (5.3–8.6) years in sub-Saharan Africa. The median age at ART start varied from 0.9 (0.4–2.6) years in North America to 7.9 (6.0–9.3) years in sub-Saharan Africa. The cumulative incidence estimates (95% confidence interval [CI]) at age 15 years for mortality, transfers out, and LTFU for all APHs were 2.6% (2.4%–2.8%), 15.6% (15.1%–16.0%), and 11.3% (10.9%–11.8%), respectively. Mortality was lowest in Europe (0.8% [0.5%–1.1%]) and highest in South America and the Caribbean (4.4% [3.1%–6.1%]). However, LTFU was lowest in South America and the Caribbean (4.8% [3.4%–6.7%]) and highest in sub-Saharan Africa (13.2% [12.6%–13.7%]). Study limitations include the high LTFU rate in sub-Saharan Africa, which could have affected the comparison of mortality across regions; inclusion of data only for APHs receiving ART from some countries; and unavailability of data from high-burden countries such as Nigeria. Conclusion: To our knowledge, our study represents the largest multiregional epidemiological analysis of APHs. Despite probable under-ascertained mortality, mortality in APHs remains substantially higher in sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and South America and the Caribbean than in Europe. Collaborations such as CIPHER enable us to monitor current global temporal trends in outcomes over time to inform appropriate policy responses. © 2018 The Collaborative Initiative for Paediatric HIV Education and Research (CIPHER) Global Cohort Collaboration et al.",,adolescent; antiretroviral therapy; article; Caribbean; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; Europe; female; follow up; HIV education; human; incidence; low income country; male; meta analysis; mortality; Nigeria; North America; retrospective study; risk assessment; secondary analysis; South America; Southeast Asia,Article

The processes of carbonization and electrospinning were merged in order to determine dopamine (DA) in a selective and sensitive manner when it is present in uric acid (UA) or ascorbic acid (AA). In order to assess the nature of the surface morphology and the physical product properties, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction were employed prior to and following the carbonization step. The modified electrode (CPAN-Au/G) in [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- and DA was examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in order to establish the electrochemical behavior. The findings from this test revealed that the modified electrode was capable of selectively identifying DA in 0.1 M PBS at pH 7.4 when other substances were present to provide interference. This process did not require the use of an anionic surfactant to serve as the discriminating agent. From the analysis of the DPV current, a linear dependence upon DA concentrations became apparent, in the range of 0.001-60 μM when the detection limit was 0.8 nM (S/N = 3) and sensitivity was 1.4351 μA cm-2. DA quantities in human serum could be effectively detected using the CPAN-Au/G electrode, and the modified electrode raises considerable expectations for application as a high-potential electrode. This would permit the determination of DA in a selective and sensitive manner while achieving sensor stability over the long term. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Anionic surfactants; Ascorbic acid; Carbon; Carbonization; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrodes; Electron microscopy; Electrospinning; Gold; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Organic acids; Scanning electron microscopy; Spinning (fibers); Transmission electron microscopy; Voltammetry; X ray diffraction; Detection limits; Differential pulse voltammetry; Electrochemical behaviors; Linear dependence; Modified electrodes; Physical products; Screen-printed carbon electrodes; Transmission electron; Electrochemical electrodes,Article

To date,radio pulsations have been detected from all rotation-powered MSPs. In an attempt to discover radio-quiet gamma-ray MSPs,we used the aggregated power from the computers of tens of thousands of volunteers participating in the Einstein@Home distributed computing project to search for pulsations from unidentified gamma-ray sources in Fermi Large Area Telescope data. This survey discovered two isolated MSPs,one of which is the only known rotation-powered MSP to remain undetected in radio observations. These gamma-ray MSPs were discovered in completely blind searches without prior constraints from other observations,raising hopes for detecting MSPs from a predicted Galactic bulge population. © 2018 The Authors,some rights reserved.",,Distributed computer systems; Pulsars; Blind searches; Emission beams; Galactic bulge; Gamma ray sources; Large area telescopes; Millisecond pulsars; Neutron stars; Radio observation; Gamma rays,Article

Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States","The incremental graph connectivity (IGC) problem is to maintain a data structure that can quickly answer whether two given vertices in a graph are connected, while allowing more edges to be added to the graph. IGC is a fundamental problem and can be solved efficiently in the sequential setting using a solution to the classical union-find problem. However, sequential solutions are not sufficient to handle modern-day large, rapidly-changing graphs where edge updates arrive at a very high rate. We present the first shared-memory parallel data structure for union-find (equivalently, IGC) that is both provably work-efficient (ie, performs no more work than the best sequential counterpart) and has polylogarithmic parallel depth. We also present a simpler algorithm with slightly worse theoretical properties, but which is easier to implement and has good practical performance.

Properties of solvent media strongly affects molecular organization during the preparation process. The use of water provides PDA assemblies with irregular shape while a sheet-like structure forms in butanol. Thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction detect the variation of crystalline fraction and interlamellar spacing in these structures. The change of solvent media significantly affects their thermochromic behaviors. Thin film of PDA assemblies prepared in butanol exhibits reversible thermochromism with much higher color-transition temperature compared to the system of water. © 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry,Color transition; Polydiacetylene; Self-assemblies; Solvent effect; Thermochromism,Acetylene; Monomers; Self assembly; Solvents; Thermoanalysis; X ray diffraction; Color transition; Crystalline fractions; Interlamellar spacing; Molecular organization; Polydiacetylenes; Solvent effects; Thermochromic behavior; Thermochromism; Film preparation,Article

Currently, mortality-associated TiLV infections have been reported in tilapia farms in Israel, Ecuador, Colombia, Egypt, Thailand, Chinese Taipei, India and Malaysia. In this study, sets of samples collected from clinically healthy adult and fingerling tilapia with no signs of diseases or mortality were randomly diagnosed for TiLV. The tissue samples were examined by semi-nested RT-PCR, histopathology, and in situ hybridization (ISH). Unexpectedly, individual organs (liver, kidney, spleen, brain, and heart) of the tested adult fish (2/2) and liver of the fingerlings (9/19) exhibited positive results in the second step RT-PCR, indicating a low viral load of TiLV in the fish tissues. Sequencing analysis of 250-bp amplicons revealed 97.2% identity to the prototype strain from Israel. Histopathology was investigated in the adult fish specimens and pathological features resembling syncytial hepatitis were observed while ISH yielded no detectable signal. Unlike previous reports, this study revealed cases of inapparent or subclinical infections of TiLV in tilapia. Underlying factors and mechanisms between host and virus resulting in inapparent infection require further scientific investigation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Inapparent infection; RT-PCR; Tilapia lake virus; TiLV,Orthomyxoviridae; Tilapia,Article

The aim of our study is to understand what features of HCP training evaluation studies are important for decision-making by policy-makers in LMICs. We investigate the extent to which evaluations based on the widely used Kirkpatrick model - focusing on direct outcomes of training, namely reaction of trainees, learning, behaviour change and improvements in programmatic health indicators - align with policy-makers' evidence needs for resource allocation decisions. We use China as a case study where resource allocation decisions about potential scale-up (using domestic funding) are being made about an externally funded pilot HCP training programme. Methods: Qualitative data were collected from high-level officials involved in resource allocation at the national and provincial level in China through ten face-to-face, in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions consisting of ten participants each. Data were analysed manually using an interpretive thematic analysis approach. Results: Our study indicates that Chinese officials not only consider information about the direct outcomes of a training programme, as captured in the Kirkpatrick model, but also need information on the resources required to implement the training, the wider or indirect impacts of training, and the sustainability and scalability to other settings within the country. In addition to considering findings presented in evaluation studies, we found that Chinese policy-makers pay close attention to whether the evaluations were robust and to the composition of the evaluation team. Conclusions: Our qualitative study indicates that training programme evaluations that focus narrowly on direct training outcomes may not provide sufficient information for policy-makers to make decisions on future training programmes. Based on our findings, we have developed an evidence-based framework, which incorporates but expands beyond the Kirkpatrick model, to provide conceptual and practical guidance that aids in the design of training programme evaluations better suited to meet the information needs of policy-makers and to inform policy decisions. © 2018 The Author(s).",Evaluation; Framework; Healthcare provider training; Informing policy decisions,adult; article; attention; behavior change; China; clinical article; controlled study; decision making; evaluation study; female; funding; health care personnel; human; human experiment; interview; learning; male; middle income country; outcome assessment; qualitative research; resource allocation; scale up; student; thematic analysis; training,Article

Its proposed mechanism is stimulation of the prostaglandin receptor in dermal papilla and melanocyte, thus leading to a prolonged anagen phase and increased melanogenesis. The hair follicle then increases in thickness, length, and darkness. The efficacy of bimatoprost for the treatment of eyebrow hypotrichosis has been supported by well-controlled studies.

The survival time of CCA patients is related to serum estrogen levels and estrogen has been found to enhance the proliferation and invasiveness of CCA cells in vitro. This has led to the suggestion that estrogen may play an important role in the progression of CCA. This study tests the relevance of the previous in vitro findings in vivo using a mouse xenograft model of CCA, and investigates possible signaling mechanisms involved. Methods: KKU-213 and KKU-139 CCA cell lines were used in the experiments, xenografted to nude mice and treated with a potent estrogenic agent, 17β-estradiol (E2), and/or with tamoxifen (TAM), an estrogen antagonist. Results: The results demonstrated that E2 could accelerate growth of the xenograft-tumor and the effect was inhibited by TAM. PCR array screening of E2 responsive genes suggested ETV4 as a promising candidate intracellular mediator. ETV4-knockdown CCA cells were generated and these showed a diminished responsiveness to E2 in both cell and spheroid proliferation assays, and in invasion tests. These results point to ETV4 as a possible mediator of E2-activated CCA progression and as a potential target of TAM-mediated inhibition. Conclusions: Finally, TAM may be suggested as an adjunctive treatment of CCA to improve the conventional cytotoxic method with more patient toleration. © 2018 The Author(s).",Cholangiocarcinoma; Estrogen; ETV4; Mouse xenografted model; Tamoxifen,estradiol; tamoxifen; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cancer chemotherapy; cancer growth; cell invasion; cell proliferation; cholangiocarcinoma cell line; controlled study; correlational study; drug activation; drug effect; drug response; drug screening; drug targeting; estrogen metabolism; ETV4 gene; gene expression; gene knockdown; in vitro study; male; mouse; nonhuman; pathophysiology; polymerase chain reaction; tumor gene; tumor growth; tumor xenograft,Article

Because activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is induced under stress conditions and is highly expressed in the hippocampus, we hypothesize that ATF3 plays a role in fear memory formation. We used fear conditioning and various other paradigms to test Atf3 knockout mice and study the role of ATF3 in processing fear memory. The results demonstrated that the lack of ATF3 specifically enhanced the expression of fear memory, which was indicated by a higher incidence of the freeze response after fear conditioning, whereas the occurrence of spatial memory including Morris Water Maze and radial arm maze remained unchanged. The enhanced freezing behavior and normal spatial memory of the Atf3 knockout mice resembles the fear response and numbing symptoms often exhibited by patients affected with posttraumatic stress disorder. Additionally, we determined that after fear conditioning, dendritic spine density was increased, and expression of Gelsolin, the gene encoding a severing protein for actin polymerization, was down-regulated in the bilateral hippocampi of the Atf3 knockout mice. Taken together, our results suggest that ATF3 may suppress fear memory formation in mice directly or indirectly through mechanisms involving modulation of actin polymerization. © 2018 Pai, Sharma, Huang, Loganathan, Lin, Hsu, Phasuk and Liu.",Actin; Anxiety; ATF3; Fear conditioning; Memory; Posttraumatic stress disorder,activating transcription factor 3; gelsolin; actin polymerization; animal experiment; Article; behavior; controlled study; down regulation; experimental locomotor activity test; fear conditioning test; gene expression; genotype; Golgi complex; hippocampus; locomotion; male; Morris water maze test; mouse; nonhuman; posttraumatic stress disorder; radial arm maze test; real time polymerase chain reaction; spatial memory; tail flick test,Article

Vanillin is flavouring agent, which is known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vanillin incorporated PMMA on adhesion of Candida albicans. A total of 36 orthodontic self-curing PMMA resin samples were fabricated. The samples were divided into 3 groups depending on percentage of vanillin incorporated (0.1%, 0.5% and PMMA without vanillin as control). PMMA samples were coated with saliva. The adhesion assay was performed with C. albicans (ATCC 10231). The adherent yeast cells were stained with crystal violet and counted under microscope by random selection of 3 fields at 10X magnification. The statistical analyses performed by Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney non-parametric test. It was found that the PMMA resin samples with vanillin incorporation significantly reduced the adhesion of C. albicans as compared to the control group. This study indicates that vanillin incorporated resin can impede the adhesion of C. albicans to about 45 - 56 %.

Since our previous investigation has indicated that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 could abolish the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]-enhanced calcium absorption, we further hypothesized that FGF-23 produced locally in the enterocytes might be part of a local negative feedback loop to regulate calcium absorption. Herein, 1,25(OH)2D3 was found to enhance the transcellular calcium transport across the epithelium-like Caco-2 monolayer, and this stimulatory effect was diminished by preceding prolonged exposure to high-dose 1,25(OH)2D3 or high concentration of apical ionized calcium. Pretreatment with a neutralizing antibody for FGF-23 prevented this negative feedback regulation of calcium hyperabsorption induced by 1,25(OH)2D3. FGF-23 exposure completely abolished the 1,25(OH)2D3-enhanced calcium transport. Western blot analysis revealed that FGF-23 expression was upregulated in a dose-dependent manner by 1,25(OH)2D3 or apical calcium exposure. Finally, calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) inhibitors were found to prevent the apical calcium-induced suppression of calcium transport. In conclusion, prolonged exposure to high apical calcium and calcium hyperabsorption were sensed by CaSR, which, in turn, increased FGF-23 expression to suppress calcium transport. This local negative feedback loop can help prevent unnecessary calcium uptake and its detrimental consequences. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Calcium transport; Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR); Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23; Intestinal epithelial cell; Vitamin D,calcitriol; calcium ion; calcium sensing receptor; fibroblast growth factor 23; neutralizing antibody; Article; Caco-2 cell line; calcium absorption; calcium cell level; calcium transport; controlled study; human; human cell; in vitro study; intestinal stem cell; negative feedback; priority journal; upregulation; Western blotting,Article

Here we take advantage of the admixed profile of Southeast Asians to perform coupled association-admixture analyses in Thai cohorts. For dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the significant haplotypes are located in genes coding for phospholipase C members (PLCB4 added to previously reported PLCE1), related to inflammation of blood vessels. For dengue fever (DF), we found evidence of significant association with CHST10, AHRR, PPP2R5E and GRIP1 genes, which participate in the xenobiotic metabolism signaling pathway. We conducted functional analyses for PPP2R5E, revealing by immunofluorescence imaging that the coded protein co-localizes with both DENV1 and DENV2 NS5 proteins. Interestingly, only DENV2-NS5 migrated to the nucleus, and a deletion of the predicted top-linking motif in NS5 abolished the nuclear transfer. These observations support the existence of differences between serotypes in their cellular dynamics, which may contribute to differential infection outcome risk. The contribution of the identified genes to the genetic risk render Southeast and Northeast Asian populations more susceptible to both phenotypes, while African populations are best protected against DSS and intermediately protected against DF, and Europeans the best protected against DF but the most susceptible against DSS. © 2018 Oliveira et al.",,alpha interferon; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; glutamate receptor; immunoglobulin M; nonstructural protein 5; nuclear receptor coactivator 2; phospholipase C; sulfotransferase; adaptive immunity; adolescent; adult; algorithm; Article; B lymphocyte; biodiversity; cell maturation; cell nucleus transplantation; child; climate change; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; consanguinity; controlled study; demography; dengue; dengue shock syndrome; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 2; disease association; disease predisposition; dynamics; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; frequency analysis; gene frequency; genotype phenotype correlation; genotyping technique; haplotype; human; immunofluorescence; infant; inflammation; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pathogenicity; preschool child; retrospective study; school child; serotype; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; vascular endothelial cell; xenobiotic metabolism; young adult,Article

Patients might suffer from a variety of the clinical symptoms of OH, including dizziness, lightheadedness, or problems with vision and fatigue. Objectives To determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and to identify any relationships between the clinical symptoms of OH and balance confidence in this patient population. Methods Symptomatic OH was defined as a systolic or diastolic BP fall of ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 mmHg respectively, within 3 min of standing and an Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) score of more than zero. Factors related to symptomatic OH were identified from a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Pearson's correlation test was used to reveal any relationships between the clinical symptoms of OH and a patient's confidence in their ability to balance, assessed using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. Results 100 Thai PD patients were consecutively recruited into this study. The prevalence of symptomatic OH was 18%, asymptomatic OH was 4%, while 78% were patients without OH. Factors associated with symptomatic OH were age (OR, 95%CI: 1.06, 1.003–1.115, p = 0.038) and hypertension (OR, 95%CI: 6.16, 1.171–32.440, p = 0.032). A significant and negative correlation (r = − 0.229, p = 0.022) between OHQ composite scores and item 3 of the ABC scale (picking up slippers from floor), one of the movements in a vertical orientation, was found. Conclusion Elderly PD patients and with a co-morbidity of essential hypertension should be closely evaluated for the presence of symptomatic OH. In addition, they should be advised to change positions slowly, especially those in a vertical orientation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Balance confidence; Parkinson's disease; Prevalence and factors associated with; Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension,amlodipine; atenolol; carvedilol; furosemide; hydrochlorothiazide; levodopa; losartan; propranolol; telmisartan; valsartan; verapamil; aged; Article; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; essential hypertension; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; orientation; orthostatic hypotension; Parkinson disease; prevalence; priority journal; systolic blood pressure,Article

KKU-PS1 were investigated. Aji-L (i.e., a waste from the process of crystallizing monosodium glutamate) was used as nitrogen source. Batch fermentation was conducted in 300 mL serum bottles with the working volume of 180 mL to investigate the optimal inoculum size by varying the initial inoculum concentration from 0.23 to 0.92 gCDW/L. The photo-fermentation was conducted at an initial pH 7.0 and 25.6 °C with continuously light illumination at 7500 lux. The optimal inoculum size of 0.77 gCDW/L gave the hydrogen production rate (Rm) and lipid production of 5.24 mL H2/L.h and 407 mg lipid/L, respectively. The hydrogen production from SMW was further examined in 1.7-L photo-bioreactor with the working volume of 1.2-L using the optimal condition from batch experiment. A photo-bioreactor yielded 1.73 times higher Rm than that obtained from the fermentation in serum bottles with a greater lipid production of 424 mg lipid/L. Hydrogen production from SMW in the repeated-batch fermentation was further studied by varying the medium replacement ratios of 25, 50–75%. A maximum biomass and lipid concentration of 2.83 gCDW/L and 685 mg lipid/L, respectively were achieved at a medium replacement ratio of 75%.

Here, we show that oncogenic RAS and BRAF induce perinuclear relocalization of several RAS pathway proteins, including the kinases CK2 and p- ERK1/2 and the signaling scaffold KSR1. This spatial reorganization requires endocytosis, the kinase activities of MEK-ERK and CK2, and the presence of KSR1. CK2a colocalizes with KSR1 and Rab11, a marker of recycling endosomes, whereas p- ERK associates predominantly with a distinct KSR1-positive endosomal population. Notably, these perinuclear signaling complexes (PSC) are present in tumor cell lines, mouse lung tumors, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts undergoing RAS-induced senescence. PSCs are also transiently induced by growth factors (GF) in nontransformed cells with delayed kinetics (4–6 hours), establishing a novel late phase of GF signaling that appears to be constitutively activated in tumor cells. PSCs provide an essential platform for RAS-induced phosphorylation and activation of the prosenescence transcription factor C/EBPb in primary MEFs undergoing senescence. Conversely, in tumor cells, C/EBPb activation is suppressed by 30UTR-mediated localization of Cebpb transcripts to a peripheral cytoplasmic domain distinct from the PSC region. Collectively, our findings indicate that sustained PSC formation is a critical feature of oncogenic RAS/BRAF signaling in cancer cells that controls signal transmission to downstream targets by regulating selective access of effector kinases to substrates such as C/EBPb. Significance: In addressing the long-standing question of the difference between normal and oncogenic RAS pathway signaling, this study shows that oncogenic RAS specifically triggers constitutive endocytosis-dependent movement of effector kinases to a perinuclear region, thereby creating connections to unique downstream targets such as the core prosenescence and the inflammatory regulatory transcription factor C/EBPb. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,casein kinase II; CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; protein CK2alpha; protein KSR1; protein serine threonine kinase; Rab11 protein; scaffold protein; unclassified drug; 3' untranslated region; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; Cebpb gene; cell aging; cellular distribution; complex formation; controlled study; cytoplasm; embryo; endosome; enzyme phosphorylation; genetic transcription; intracellular signaling; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene; oncogene BRAF; oncogene ras; perinuclear signaling complex; priority journal; protein localization; senescence,Article

The objective was to evaluate management, outcomes, adherence to sepsis bundles, and mortality prediction of maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores in patients with community-acquired sepsis in Southeast Asia. Methods: We prospectively recruited hospitalized adults within 24 h of admission with community-acquired infection at nine public hospitals in Indonesia (n=3), Thailand (n=3), and Vietnam (n=3). In patients with organ dysfunction (total SOFA score ≥2), we analyzed sepsis management and outcomes and evaluated mortality prediction of the SOFA scores. Organ failure was defined as the maximum SOFA score ≥3 for an individual organ system. Results: From December 2013 to December 2015, 454 adult patients presenting with community-acquired sepsis due to diverse etiologies were enrolled. Compliance with sepsis bundles within 24 h of admission was low: broad-spectrum antibiotics in 76% (344/454), ≥1500 mL fluid in 50% of patients with hypotension or lactate ≥4 mmol/L (115/231), and adrenergic agents in 71% of patients with hypotension (135/191). Three hundred and fifty-five patients (78%) were managed outside of ICUs. Ninety-nine patients (22%) died. Total SOFA score on admission of those who subsequently died was significantly higher than that of those who survived (6.7 vs. 4.6, p<0.001). The number of organ failures showed a significant correlation with 28-day mortality, which ranged from 7% in patients without any organ failure to 47% in those with failure of at least four organs (p<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the total SOFA score for discrimination of mortality was 0.68 (95% CI 0.62-0.74). Conclusions: Community-acquired sepsis in Southeast Asia due to a variety of pathogens is usually managed outside the ICU and with poor compliance to sepsis bundles. In this population, calculation of SOFA scores is feasible and SOFA scores are associated with mortality. © 2018 The Author(s).",Asia; Organ dysfunction scores; Patient care bundles; Sepsis; Southeastern,adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; noradrenalin; acute diarrhea; adult; aged; Article; body weight; central nervous system; chronic lung disease; clinical trial; community acquired infection; Glasgow coma scale; hospital laboratory; hospitalization; human; hypotension; major clinical study; male; medical record; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; observational study; organ dysfunction score; patient care; priority journal; prospective study; public hospital; respiratory tract infection; sepsis; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; Southeast Asia; treatment outcome; young adult,Article

The time at maximum absorbance was found to linearly increase with increasing particle size, suggesting that ETAAS can be applied to provide the size information of nanoparticles. With the atomization temperature of 1600 °C, the mixtures of nanoparticles containing two particle sizes, i.e., 5 nm tannic stabilized AuNPs with 60, 80, 100 nm citrate stabilized AuNPs, were investigated and bimodal peaks were observed. The particle size dependent atomization behaviors of nanoparticles show potential application of ETAAS for providing size information of nanoparticles. The calibration plot between the time at maximum absorbance and the particle size was applied to estimate the particle size of in-house synthesized AuNPs and AgNPs and the results obtained were in good agreement with those from flow field-flow fractionation (FlFFF) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Furthermore, the linear relationship between the activation energy and the particle size was observed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Atomization; Electrothermal atomic absorption; Gold nanoparticles; Particle size; Silver nanoparticles,Absorption spectroscopy; Activation energy; Atomic absorption spectrometry; Atomization; Atoms; Electric heating; Fiber optic sensors; Fractionation; Gold; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Liquid chromatography; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Spectrometry; Transmission electron microscopy; Electrothermal atomic absorption; Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry; Flow field flow fractionations; Gold and silver nanoparticles; Gold Nanoparticles; Particle size information; Silver nanoparticles; Silver nanoparticles (AgNps); Silver; gold nanoparticle; silver nanoparticle; Article; atomic absorption; atomic absorption spectrometry; calibration; decomposition; energy; field flow fractionation; nebulization; particle size; priority journal; spectral sensitivity; temperature; transmission electron microscopy,Article

The haplotypic reference of choice for imputation in Southeast Asian populations is unclear. Moreover, the influence of SNP annotation on imputation results has not been examined. Methods: This study was divided into two parts. In the first part, we applied imputation to genotyped SNPs from Southeast Asian populations from the Pan-Asian SNP database. Five percent of the total SNPs were removed. The remaining SNPs were applied to imputation with IMPUTE2. The imputed outcomes were verified with the removed SNPs. We compared imputation references from Chinese and Japanese haplotypes from the HapMap phase II (HMII) and the complete set of haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G). The second part was imputation accuracy and yield in Thai patient dataset. Half of the autosomal SNPs was removed to create Set 1. Another dataset, Set 2, was then created where we switched which half of the SNPs were removed. Both Set 1 and Set 2 were imputed with HMII to create a complete imputed SNPs dataset. The dataset was used to validate association testing, SNPs annotation and imputation outcome. Results: The accuracy was highest for all populations when using the HMII reference, but at the cost of a lower yield. Thai genotypes showed the highest accuracy over other populations in both HMII and 1000G panels, although accuracy and yield varied across chromosomes. Imputation was tested in a clinical dataset to compare accuracy in gene-related regions, and coding regions were found to have a higher accuracy and yield. Conclusions: This work provides the first evidence of imputation reference selection for Southeast Asian studies and highlights the effects of SNP locations respective to genes on imputation outcome. Researchers will need to consider the trade-off between accuracy and yield in future imputation studies. © 2018 The Author(s).",Genotype; Imputation; Pan-Asian SNP; Reference; SNP annotation,adult; article; chromosome; controlled study; gene frequency; gene mutation; genetic association; genome; haplotype map; human; scientist; single nucleotide polymorphism; Thai (citizen); validation process,Article

Protection against high temperature stress in eukaryotes is coordinated by heat shock factors (HSFs), transcription factors that activate the expression of protective chaperones such as HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 70 (HSP70); however, the pathway by which temperature is sensed and integrated with other environmental signals into adaptive responses is not well understood. Plants are exposed to considerable diurnal variation in temperature, and we have found that there is diurnal variation in thermotolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana, with maximal thermotolerance coinciding with higher HSP70 expression during the day. In a forward genetic screen, we identified a key role for the chloroplast in controlling this response, suggesting that light-induced chloroplast signaling plays a key role. Consistent with this, we are able to globally activate binding of HSFA1a to its targets by altering redox status in planta independently of a heat shock. Plants are most resilient to heat stress during the day, a response controlled by HSFA1 transcription factors activating heat shock genes. Dickinson et al. find that perturbations of chloroplast electron transport affect heat shock gene expression. They show that HSFA1 activity is gated by a light-dependent chloroplast signal. © 2018 The Author(s)",Arabidopsis; chloroplast; diurnal; HSF; HSP70; light; plastoquinone; thermotolerance,heat shock protein 70; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; chloroplast; chloroplast signaling; circadian rhythm; controlled study; correlation analysis; gene expression; heat tolerance; high temperature; HSP70 gene; nonhuman; photoactivation; photosynthesis; plant gene; priority journal; signal transduction,Article

The pelvic involvement of disease is rare even in an endemic area. Therefore, we describe in this report the clinical presentation, management, and outcome of the patient with primary tubo-ovarian abscess due to melioidosis. Case presentation: A 31-year-old Thai cassava farmer woman presented with fever and abdominal pain at left lower quadrant for one month. She also had pain, swelling, and redness of the genitalia without any ulcer. She had odorless whitish vaginal discharge. The pelvic examination revealed excitation pain on the left side of her cervix. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a large left tubo-ovarian abscess size 9.4 × 4.8 cm located at anterior of the uterus. Urgent exploratory laparotomy revealed left hydrosalpinx with a large amount of pus. The pus culture grew Burkholderia pseudomallei. The computer tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple hepatosplenic abscesses. The patient underwent left salpingo-oophorectomy and pus drainage. The pathological examination of excised left adnexa revealed chronic and acute suppurative inflammation with necrotic tissue. She was given intravenous ceftazidime for one month, and her clinical symptom improved. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus at this visit and treated with insulin injection. She continued to take oral co-trimoxazole for 20 weeks. The final diagnosis was disseminated melioidosis with left tubo-ovarian abscess and hepatosplenic abscesses in a newly diagnosed morbidly obese diabetic patient. Conclusion:Burkholderia pseudomallei should be considered as the causative organism of gynecologic infection among patient with risk factor resided in an endemic area who do not respond to standard antibiotics. The pus culture from the site of infection is the only diagnostic method of pelvic melioidosis, appropriate antibiotics, and adequate surgical drainage were the components of the successful outcome. © 2018 The Author(s).",Burkholderia pseudomallei; Melioidosis; Ovarian abscess; Pelvic inflammatory disease,"ceftazidime; clindamycin; cotrimoxazole; doxycycline; gentamicin; insulin; metronidazole; antiinfective agent; ceftazidime; cotrimoxazole; abdominal pain; adnexa disease; adnexitis; adult; agricultural worker; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium examination; body mass; Burkholderia pseudomallei; case report; chill; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; diabetic patient; female; fever; genital erythema; hemagglutination test; histopathology; human; human tissue; hydrosalpinx; laparotomy; liver abscess; melioidosis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; ovary abscess; pelvic examination; risk factor; salpingooophorectomy; spleen abscess; swelling; thorax radiography; tissue necrosis; transvaginal echography; tubo ovarian abscess; vagina discharge; wound dehiscence; abdominal abscess; abdominal pain; Australia; Burkholderia pseudomallei; complication; melioidosis; microbiology; morbid obesity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathogenicity; suppuration; Thailand; x-ray computed tomography; Abdominal Abscess; Abdominal Pain; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Australia; Burkholderia pseudomallei; Ceftazidime; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Melioidosis; Obesity, Morbid; Suppuration; Thailand; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination",Article

Properly functioning endothelial cells promote physiological balance and stability for blood circulation and fluid components. A monolayer of endothelial cells has the ability to regulate paracellular and transcellular pathways for transport proteins, solutes, and fluid. In addition to the paracellular pathway, the transcellular pathway is another route of endothelial permeability that mediates vascular permeability under physiologic conditions. The transcellular pathway was found to be associated with an assortment of disease pathogeneses. The clinical manifestation of severe dengue infection in humans is vascular leakage and hemorrhagic diatheses. This review explores and describes the transcellular pathway, which is an alternate route of vascular permeability during dengue infection that corresponds with the pathologic finding of intact tight junction. This pathway may be the route of albumin transport that causes endothelial dysfunction during dengue virus infection. © 2018 by the authors.

However, until now there was no report of the occurrence of human cases of T. asiatica in Lao PDR. This study, conducted in Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR, microscopically examined a total of 470 fecal samples by Kato Katz method and found 86% of people harboring at least one helminth. Hookworms were detected in 56% of the samples besides Opisthorchis like eggs (42%), Trichuris trichiura (27%), Ascaris spp. (14%), and Taenia spp. (4%) eggs. Serology for cysticercosis showed 6.8% positives with results varying from 3% to 14.3% in Ethnic School students and Kalouk Kao village respectively. Species-specific PCR targeting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 28 tapeworms, recovered from 16 patients, revealed T. solium (n = 2), T. saginata (n = 21), and T. asiatica (n = 5). Two patients were confirmed to be coinfected with T. saginata and T. asiatica, indicating the endemicity of the 3 human Taenia in Lao PDR. However, nucleotide sequencing of a nuclear DNA gene, DNA polymerase delta (pold) revealed that all the tapeworms identified as T. asiatica using mtDNA had T. saginata type allele at pold locus, demonstrating that they are not “pure T. asiatica” but the hybrid descendants between the two species, confirming the wide distribution of hybrids of T. saginata/ T. asiatica in Southeast Asia. The high prevalence of several helminthic NTDs in east Savannakhet area even with conventional control measures indicates the importance to establish wide and multifaceted health programs to sustainably improve the quality of life of the populations living in these communities. © 2018 Sato et al.",,anthelmintic agent; cell nucleus DNA; DNA polymerase; mitochondrial DNA; adult; aged; anthelmintic activity; antihelminthic therapy; Article; child; cysticercosis; DNA extraction; endemic disease; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; feces analysis; female; genotype; human; immunoblotting; interspecific hybrid; male; mixed infection; nonhuman; Opisthorchis; parasite serodiagnosis; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; quality of life; sequence analysis; Southeast Asia; Taenia asiatica; Taenia saginata; Taenia solium; taeniasis; tropical disease,Article

Similar to tuberculous infection, the presentation can masquerade as low-grade granulomatous intraocular inflammation with partial response to corticosteroids. Besides, the special requirements for culture make this pathogen difficult to diagnose. The study aims to report the clinical presentation and notify the awareness of NTM endophthalmitis among clinicians. This is the first case report of late-onset, postoperative M. haemophilum endophthalmitis in the literature. Case presentation: A 66-year-old man with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) manifested chronic granulomatous inflammation in the left eye after multiple glaucoma surgeries. With a diagnosis of noninfectious panuveitis, he was treated with systemic corticosteroids. The inflammation initially responded to therapy although it subsequently worsened and became purulent endophthalmitis. The vitreous cultures grew M. haemophilum. Intraocular and systemic antimicrobial treatments were administered early, but the patient eventually turned blind. Conclusions:M. haemophilum endophthalmitis is a rare but serious intraocular complication leading to loss of vision or eyeball. Awareness of atypical mycobacterial infections is necessary especially in patients with impaired immune function, previous intraocular surgery, and corticosteroid resistance. Proper laboratory investigations and treatments should be performed. However, due to the rarity of the disease, the development of guidelines for its investigation and therapy is still challenging. © 2018 The Author(s).",Atypical mycobacteria; Endophthalmitis; Mycobacterium haemophilum; Non-tuberculous mycobacteria,"amikacin; azithromycin; ceftazidime; ciprofloxacin; clarithromycin; corticosteroid; doxycycline; imipenem; levofloxacin; prednisolone; rifampicin; tobramycin; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; aged; Article; B scan; bacterial eye infection; bedtime dosage; best corrected visual acuity; blurred vision; case report; clinical article; deterioration; differential diagnosis; disease duration; disease severity; endophthalmitis; eye examination; eye pain; eye redness; eye surgery; glaucoma surgery; histopathology; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; intraocular pressure; iris membranectomy; late onset disorder; low vision; male; medical history; Mycobacterium haemophilum; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; open angle glaucoma; ophthalmoscopy; pars plana vitrectomy; polymerase chain reaction; postoperative infection; recurrent disease; slit lamp microscopy; Thai (citizen); thorax radiography; time to treatment; trabeculectomy; treatment duration; treatment response; uveitis; complication; endophthalmitis; glaucoma; microbiology; mycobacteriosis; Mycobacterium haemophilum; pathogenicity; postoperative complication; uveitis; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Endophthalmitis; Glaucoma; Humans; Male; Mycobacterium haemophilum; Mycobacterium Infections; Postoperative Complications; Uveitis",Article

Recently, the NR is used in natural rubber glove ( NRG) manufacturing in the industrial and medical fields. This research aims to investigate the electromagnetic wave propagation and heat transfer in NRG due to heating with microwave energy within the microwave oven at a microwave frequency of 2.45 GHz. Three-dimensional model of NRG and microwave oven are considered in this work. The comparative effects of waveguide position on the electric field and temperature profile in NRG when subjected to microwave energy are discussed. The finite element method (FEM) is used to solve the transient Maxwell's equation coupled with the transient heat transfer equation. The simulation results with computer programs are validated with experimental results. The placement of waveguides in three cases are left hand side of microwave oven, right hand side of microwave oven and left and right hand sides of microwave oven are investigated. The findings revealed that the placing the waveguide on the right side of the microwave oven gives the highest electric field and temperature profile. The values obtained provide an indication toward understanding the study of heat transfer in NRG during microwave heating in the industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Electric fields; Electromagnetic wave propagation; Finite element method; Maxwell equations; Microwave heating; Microwave ovens; Rubber; Rubber applications; Rubber products; Shoe manufacture; Temperature control; Waveguides; Electric field and temperatures; Medical fields; Microwave energies; Right-hand sides; Rubber bands; Temperature profiles; Three-dimensional model; Transient heat transfer; Microwaves,Conference Paper

This study considers the computationally determine water and air temperature distributions, water and air velocity distributions and thermal efficiency of the infrared gas stove. The goal of this work is to investigate the effect of various pot diameters i.e. 220 mm, 240 mm and 260 mm on the water and air temperature distributions, water and air velocity distributions and thermal efficiency of the infrared gas stove. The time-dependent heat transfer equation involving diffusion and convection coupled with the time-dependent fluid dynamic equation is implemented and is solved by using the finite element method (FEM). The computer simulation study is validated with an experimental study, which is use standard experiment by LPG test for low-pressure gas stove in households (TIS No. 2312-2549). The findings revealed that the water and air temperature distributions increase with greater heating time, which varies with the three different pot diameters (220 mm, 240 mm and 260 mm). Similarly, the greater heating time, the water and air velocity distributions increase that vary by pot diameters (220, 240 and 260 mm). The maximum water temperature in the case of pot diameter of 220 mm is higher than the maximum water velocity in the case of pot diameters of 240 mm and 260 mm, respectively. However, the maximum air temperature in the case of pot diameter of 260 mm is higher than the maximum water velocity in the case of pot diameters of 240 mm and 220 mm, respectively. The obtained results may provide a basis for improving the energy efficiency of infrared gas stoves and other equipment, including helping to reduce energy consumption. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Air; Atmospheric temperature; Energy utilization; Finite element method; Fluid dynamics; Gas stoves; Gases; Heating; Temperature distribution; Velocity; Velocity distribution; Air velocity distributions; Diffusion and convection; Domestic cooking stove; Fluid dynamic equations; Numerical investigations; Reduce energy consumption; Time-dependent heat transfer; Water temperatures; Energy efficiency,Conference Paper

Since 2015, cobalt is listed as a prohibited substance by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) with a urinary threshold of 0.1 μg cobalt per mL urine. To prevent the misuse of cobalt in racehorse, a simple method for detection of cobalt is desirable. In this work, the detection of cobalt is based on the spectrometric detection of the complex formation between cobalt(II) and 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-[N-n-propyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)amino]aniline at pH 4. The absorbance of the complex is monitored at 602 nm. The metal:ligand ratio of the complex is 1:2.

Here, we report a novel mutation in a patient from Thailand who presented with chronic hemolytic anemia. Methods: A comprehensive hematology and DNA analysis was applied in the index patient and her mother. Results: Hematological and hemoglobin analyses were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of Hb E/β0-thalassemia. However, we could find only Hb E heterozygous mutation using our common polymerase chain reaction-based mutation detection of the β-globin genes. Furthermore, the molecular analysis demonstrated a novel T-deletion at codon 42 of the second exon of the β-globin gene which we named ‘Hb Yala’ according to the origin of this index family. Discussion: This mutation was assumed to generate a truncated β-globin chain terminating at codon 60 with possible unstable variant leading to a ‘null’ or β0-thalassemia. However, the clinical phenotype was surprisingly mild and no other ameliorating genetic factors, including co-inheritance of α-thalassemia and high propensity of Hb F by Xmn I polymorphism, were found. Conclusion: This report has provided evidence that genotype–phenotype correlation in thalassemia syndromes is highly complex and a correct clinical severity classification of thalassemia should be mainly based on clinical evaluation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",frameshift mutation; Hb E/β-thalassemia; hemoglobin variant; hemoglobin Yala; non-transfusion-dependent thalasssemia; thalassemia; transfusion-dependent thalassemia; β-Globin mutation,hemoglobin beta chain; hemoglobin E; hemoglobin F; hemoglobin yala; iron; unclassified drug; alpha thalassemia; Article; blood transfusion; case report; child; clinical article; DNA determination; DNA structure; female; frameshift mutation; gene deletion; gene expression; genetic polymorphism; genetic susceptibility; globin gene; hemoglobin analysis; hemoglobin E-beta thalassemia; hepatomegaly; heterozygosity; human; phenotype; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; school child; splenomegaly,Article

It is widely used in In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) in which sperms will be held in a micro-needle and penetrate to an oocyte for fertilization. IVF needs to be performed by high skill embryologists to control the movement of the needle accurately due to the lack of tactile perception of the user. Haptic device is a device that can transmit and simulate position, velocity and force in order to enhance interaction between the user and system. However, commercially available haptic devices have unnecessary degrees of freedom and limited workspace which are inappropriate for IVF process. This paper focuses on development of a haptic device for using in IVF process. It will be used as a master arm for the master-slave system for IVF process in order to enhance the ability of users to control the micromanipulator. As a result, the embryologist is able to carry out the IVF process more effectively with having tactile perception. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Micromanipulators; Needles; Haptic devices; In-vitro; Limited workspaces; Master-slave systems; Mechanical device; Microneedles; Planar parallel manipulators; Tactile perception; Indium compounds,Conference Paper

Why AP only is still used is largely unknown. Methods and results Factors associated with AP monotherapy prescription were analysed in GARFIELD-AF, a registry of patients with newly diagnosed (6 weeks) AF and 1 investigator-determined stroke risk factor. We analysed 51 270 patients from 35 countries enrolled into five sequential cohorts between 2010 and 2016. Overall, 20.7% of patients received AP monotherapy, 52.1% AC monotherapy, and 14.1% AP AC. Most AP monotherapy (82.5%) and AC monotherapy (86.8%) patients were CHA2DS2-VASc 2. Compared with patients on AC monotherapy, AP monotherapy patients were frequently Chinese (vs. Caucasian, odds ratio 2.73) and more likely to have persistent AF (1.32), history of coronary artery disease (2.41) or other vascular disease (1.67), bleeding (2.11), or dementia (1.81). The odds for AP monotherapy increased with 5 years of age increments for patients 75 years (1.24) but decreased with age increments for patients 55-75 years (0.86). Antiplatelet monotherapy patients were less likely to have paroxysmal (0.67) or permanent AF (0.57), history of embolism (0.56), or alcohol use (0.90). With each cohort, AP monotherapy declined (P 0.0001), especially non-indicated use. AP AC and no antithrombotic therapy were unchanged. However, even in 2015 and 2016, about 50% of AP-Treated patients had no indication except AF (71% were CHA2DS2-VASc 2). Conclusion Prescribing AP monotherapy in newly diagnosed AF has declined, but even nowadays a substantial proportion of AP-Treated patients with AF have no indication for AP.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of sexual assault in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Thailand. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey adult female participants were systematically screened (self-administered or interview administered) for IPV in antenatal care and general outpatient clinics in nine randomly selected hospitals in two provinces in the central region. Measures included the Abuse Assessment Screen, Severity of Violence Against Women Scale, Danger assessment and suicidal behaviour. Results: From 14,288 women screened, 1.5% were positive for IPV and 207 participated in the study. The mean age of the study participants was 26.8 years (SD=9.3). Fifty-seven women, 27.5% of the sample, reported sexual assault, one or more times, during the relationship in the past 12 months. Most reported some form of psychological abuse (82.1%), physical violence (67.1%) and danger (72.0%). In all, 21.3% reported psychological, physical and sexual violence. Bivariate analyses found that older age, being recruited in the general out-patient department, greater number of children, high psychological abuse, high physical violence, danger and suicidal behaviour in the past 12 months were associated with sexual assault. In multivariable backward conditional logistic regression physical violence (OR=5.32, CI=2.52-11.24) and suicidal behaviour (OR=3.28, CI=1.37-7.83) were found to be associated with sexual assault. Conclusions: The study found a moderate rate of sexual assault in intimate violent partner relationships and those sexual assaults are more likely to co-occur with physical intimate partner violence and suicidal behaviour. This knowledge may be helpful in the detection and management of sexual assault in intimate violent partner relationships of women in health care settings in Thailand. © 2018 The Author(s).",Danger; Intimate partner; Physical violence; Psychological abuse; Sexual assault; Thailand,adult; age; Article; controlled study; crime; cross-sectional study; family size; female; femicide; hazard; high risk population; human; interview; outpatient; partner violence; physical violence; prenatal care; prevalence; psychotrauma; screening; sexual violence; substance use; suicidal behavior; Thailand; violence; women's health,Article

As opposed to the other more extensively studied mangostins, scarce research has been conducted on neuroprotective effects of γ-mangostin on models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, this investigation aimed to elucidate its antioxidant and neuroprotective effects on 6-OHDA-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. 6-OHDA treatment, an inducer of PD pathology in vitro studies, decreased cell viability and increased the level of intracellular ROS production. Furthermore, the substance-induced the expression of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, negatively affected the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and increased caspase-3 activity; all of which were factors that are associated with apoptosis. Pretreatment of cells with γ-mangostin at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2.5 μM markedly increased cell survival and reduced the level of intracellular ROS formation as shown by DPPH radical scavenging activity of the compound. Furthermore, a significant suppression of p-p38, improved Bax/Bcl-2 ratio expression, and reduced caspase-3 activity was exhibited in the cells after γ-mangostin pretreatment. The reduction of apoptosis was further supported by the reduction of pyknotic nuclei indicated by Hoescht 33342 staining. These findings indicate that γ-mangostin could attenuate 6-OHDA-induced neuronal cell death and that the protective effect of γ-mangostin is associated with its antioxidative potential and through the modulation of the apoptotic signalling pathway. Therefore, γ-mangostin may be an effective xanthone among other mangostins for preventing neurodegeneration in PD caused by oxidative stress. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",6-OHDA; Bax/Bcl-2 ratio; Caspase-3; p-p38; ROS; γ-mangostin,antioxidant; caspase 3; gamma mangostin; hoe 33342; mitogen activated protein kinase 14; neuroprotective agent; oxidopamine; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; reactive oxygen metabolite; synaptophysin; trolox C; unclassified drug; xanthone derivative; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; cell death; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DPPH radical scavenging assay; drug efficacy; enzyme activity; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; Parkinson disease; priority journal; protein expression; SH-SY5Y cell line; signal transduction; upregulation,Article

Although appropriate farm management strategies can decrease the YHV infection rate in shrimp, an epidemic of the virus remains, with no specific anti-YHV therapy. Previous reports have identified PmYRP65 as a protein that mediates YHV entry into susceptible cells, and studies using RNA interference have shown that systemic administration of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) directed to PmYRP65 are able to provide protection against infection. This study sought to determine whether recombinant PmYRP65 protein (rPmYRP65) would be able to act as a competitive binding protein to neutralize YHV infection. To undertake this a cDNA encoding PmYRP65 was cloned, and rPmYRP65 was expressed, purified and characterized for its ability to neutralize YHV infection before injection into shrimp.

Bilateral CCAs account for 11-29% of patients and are commonly associated with structural weaknesses in the ICA wall, secondary to systemic hypertension. CCAs are considered benign lesions, given the low risk for developing major neurologic morbidities (i.e., subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, or carotid cavernous fistula). Moreover, concurrent presentation with posterior circulation cerebral infarction is even rarer, given different circulation territory from CCA. Here, we report on a patient with bilateral giant CCAs who presented with both typical and atypical symptoms. Case presentation: An 88-year-old hypertensive woman presented with acute vertical oblique binocular diplopia, followed by complete ptosis of the right eye. Ophthalmic examination showed dysfunction of the right third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. Further examination revealed hypesthesia of the areas supplied by the ophthalmic (V1) and maxillary (V2) branches of the right trigeminal nerve. Bilateral giant cavernous carotid aneurysms, with a concurrent subacute right occipital lobe infarction, were discovered on brain imaging and angiogram. Additionally, a prominent right posterior communicating artery (PCOM) was revealed. Seven months later, clinical improvement with stable radiographic findings was documented without any intervention. Conclusions: Dysfunction of the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, and the ophthalmic (V1) and maxillary (V2) branches of the trigeminal nerves, should necessitate brain imaging, with special attention given to the cavernous sinus. Despite unilateral symptomatic presentation, bilateral lesions cannot be excluded solely on the basis of clinical findings. CCA should be included in the differential diagnosis of cavernous sinus lesions. Although rare, ipsilateral posterior circulation cerebral infarction (i.e., occipital lobe infarction) can occur in CCA patients, presumably as a result of distal embolization through an ipsilateral, prominent PCOM. Spontaneous clinical improvement with stable radiographic support may occur. © 2018 The Author(s).",Bilateral; Cavernous carotid aneurysms; Giant; Occipital lobe infarction,"brain infarction; carotid artery disease; case report; cavernous sinus thrombosis; diagnostic imaging; diplopia; female; human; internal carotid artery; intracranial aneurysm; magnetic resonance angiography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital lobe; pathology; ptosis; very elderly; visual field; Aged, 80 and over; Blepharoptosis; Brain Infarction; Carotid Artery Diseases; Carotid Artery, Internal; Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis; Diplopia; Female; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Occipital Lobe; Visual Fields",Article

We are reporting an outbreak investigation of histamine poisoning from ingestion of fried insects. Methods: On 24 July 2014, a group of students at a seminar presented to Angthong Provincial Hospital, Thailand, with pruritic rash after ingesting snacks consisting of fried insects from a vendor. We initiated an outbreak investigation with retrospective cohort design and collected samples of remaining foods for analyses. Attack rates, relative risks and their confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: Out of 227 students, 28 developed illnesses that were consistent with our case definition which included, flushing, pruritus, urticarial rashes, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea and bronchospasm. Two children were hospitalized for progressive bronchospasm overnight without serious complications. The types of food ingested included a lunch that was provided at the seminar for all students and snacks that 41 students bought from the only vendor in the vicinity. The snacks included fried grasshoppers, silkworm pupae, common green frogs, bamboo borers, crickets and meat balls. The attack rates were highest (82.6 and 85.0%) among students who ingested fried grasshoppers and silkworm pupae and lowest (4.4 and 5.3%) among those who did not ingest them, with relative risk of 18.7 (95% CI 9.6–36.4) for grasshoppers and 16.0 (95% CI 8.8–29.3) for silkworm pupae. Histamine concentrations in the fried grasshoppers and silkworm pupae were 9.73 and 7.66 mg/100g, respectively. Discussion and conclusion: Through epidemiological analysis and laboratory confirmation, we have illustrated that histamine poisoning can occur from ingestion of fried insects. We postulate that histidine, which is present in high concentration in grasshoppers and silkworm pupae, is decarboxylated by bacteria to histamine, a heat stable toxin. The ingestion of histamine is responsible for the clinical pictures being reported. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",anaphylaxis; Entomophagy; food allergy; scombroid; silkworm,chlorpheniramine; domperidone; histamine; salbutamol; abdominal pain; adolescent; adult; Article; bamboo; Bombyx mori; bronchospasm; Caelifera; chest tightness; cohort analysis; diarrhea; dizziness; dyspnea; Ensifera; flushing; food intake; food poisoning; headache; human; insect; major clinical study; meat; nausea; paresthesia; pruritus; pupa; rash; retrospective study; risk factor; student; Thailand; vomiting,Article

We aimed to find the relationship between the arterial lactate and the peripheral venous lactate before reasoned that the venous lactate could be used in substitution to the arterial lactate in sepsis. Methods: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study at a university hospital. The patients with sepsis in ICU who required lactate level monitoring were enrolled in this research. The correlation and agreement between arterial lactate (A-LACT) and peripheral venous lactate (V-LACT) were the primary outcomes. Results: A total of 63 paired samples were collected. The A-LACT and V-LACT were strongly correlated (r ¼ .934, P &lt; .0001, r2 ¼ .873). The regression equation was A-LACT ¼ (0.934 × V-LACT) 0.236. The mean difference between V-LACT and A-LACT was 0.66 + 1.53 mmol/L. The 95% limits of agreement were between 3.66 and 2.33 mmol/L. The V-LACT ≥ 4 mmol/L can predict A-LACT level ≥ 4 mmol/L with 87.5% sensitivity and 91.5% specificity, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.948. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated a strong correlation between A-LACT and V-LACT, but an agreement between both parameters was poor. We suggest not to use the V-LACT in substitution to the A-LACT in sepsis regarding the absolute value and clearance rate, but the V-LACT ≥ 4.5 mmol/L may be used for predicting the A-LACT ≥ 4 mmol/L. © 2018, SAGE Publications Inc.

Study Design: Randomized crossover, noninferiority, tertiary center setting. Methods: Fifty patients with a mean age of 49.5 ± 10.6 years were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5 events/hour, and oxygen saturation ≥70%. Exclusion criteria were temporomandibular joint disorders, severe periodontitis, inadequate teeth, and unstable medical diseases. Treatment intolerance was considered a failure. Two-week periods without treatment were followed by questionnaires and randomization into two groups: CPAP/AT-MAS (25) and AT-MAS/CPAP (25). After 6 weeks of intervention, questionnaires and home WatchPAT monitoring were performed. Following each 2-week washout period, patients crossed over to the other treatment followed by similar procedures. Primary outcomes involved the scores from the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ). Secondary outcomes were AHI, side effects, and treatment adherence. Results: Seven patients withdrew from this study: five (AT-MAS intolerance) and two (lost follow-up). There was no significant difference among FOSQ scores, particularly on global scores, between both treatments (0.57, 95% confidential interval of difference: −0.15 to 1.29). Mean AHI decreased from pretreatment 39.2 ± 2.53 to 2.56 ± 0.49 and 12.92 ± 2.05 events/hour while using CPAP and the AT-MAS, respectively (P <.05). Most common side effects of CPAP were dry throat and inconvenience to carry, whereas those of the AT-MAS were jaw pain and excessive salivation. Conclusions: Both devices improved short-term quality of life similarly; however, the AT-MAS was not as efficacious as CPAP on resolving sleep-test parameters. The AT-MAS might be considered only a temporary treatment alternative. Level of Evidence: 1b.

Unfortunately, standard treatments for this condition have shown disappointing results. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is commonly indicated for skin laxity, but recently was used to treat UV-induced hyperpigmentation in animal models. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound for UVB-induced hyperpigmentation in human subjects. A randomized, evaluator-blinded pilot study was conducted on 20 subjects. Each subject was induced three hyperpigmentary spots by local broadband UVB. After 2 weeks, each spot was randomly allocated to control, low-energy, and high-energy HIFU. Subjects were instructed to follow up weekly for a duration of 1 month. Lightness index measurements, mean improvement scores, subjects’ satisfaction, pain scores, and side effects were evaluated. All 20 subjects completed the study. Fourteen subjects had Fitzpatrick (FPT) skin type III and six subjects had FPT skin type IV. Twelve subjects showed greater improvement at control sites while eight subjects showed greater improvement at HIFU-treated sites. In FPT skin type III, HIFU appeared to be inferior to control in both lightness index and mean improvement scores, but in FPT skin type IV, HIFU had greater lightness index improvement and higher improvement scores than control. Side effects were more frequent in high-energy-treated areas. Focused ultrasound may be offered in some patients with hyperpigmentary conditions.

Wall. ex Nees, and to clarify action mode of andrographolide. Methods: The chemical composition was extracted by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol, respectively. Andrographolide and its derivatives were evaluated by HPLC. Moreover, the metabolic profiling was analyzed by GC-MS. Inhibitory effect of crude extracts was tested against Staphylococcus aureus using agar well diffusion method. Mode of action was tested against mutant yeast by spotting assay. Andrographolide were tested for their mode of action against eukaryotes. Results: Among different solvents, dichloromethane gave the highest yield of crude (3.58% DW), with the highest andrographolide content (8.3 mg/g DW). The effect of plant hormone (10 mg/L GA3 or PBZ) on phytochemical variations and bioactivity of Andrographis paniculata was demonstrated. It was found that PBZ promoted sesquiterpene compounds about 3.5 times over than GA3 treatment. But inhibitory effect of extracts against Staphylococcus aureus was highest in GA3 treated plants; andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide contents were significantly higher than those of water or PBZ. It was found that there were 11 strains involving in ergosterol biosynthesis, V-ATPase activity and homeostasis, and superoxide detoxification process. In this regard, andrographolide might cause the damage on the lipid bilayer of yeast cell and plasma membrane by interfering ergosterol biosynthesis. Conclusions: It is found that GA3 promotes andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide content while PBZ promotes sesquiterpene content. Andrographolide might cause the damage on the lipid bilayer of yeast cell and plasma membrane by interfering ergosterol biosynthesis.

The causative agents of dengue are dengue viruses. For dengue virus replication, the dengue virus NS5 protein is of special importance as it has several enzyme activities important for viral replication. Previous reports of phosphorylation and SUMOylation of dengue NS5 have shown these protein modifications have important consequences for NS5 functions. In this report we identify glutathionylation, another reversible post translation modification that impacts on NS5 enzyme activity. Using dengue virus infected cells we employed specific antibodies and mass spectrometry to identify 3 cysteine residues of NS5 protein as being glutathionylated. Glutathionylation is a post translational protein modification where glutathione is covalently attached to a cysteine residue. We showed glutathionylation occurs on 3 conserved cysteine residues of dengue NS5. Then we generated two flavivirus recombinant full length proteins, dengue NS5 and Zika NS5, to characterize two of the NS5 enzyme activities, namely, guanylyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities. We show glutathionylation of dengue and Zika NS5 affects enzyme activities of the two flavivirus proteins. The data suggests that glutathionylation is a general feature of the flavivirus NS5 protein and the modification has the potential to modulate several of the NS5 enzyme functions. © 2018 Saisawang et al.

In this study we have reconstructed defined consortia biofilms in vitro of microorganisms identified as prevalent in a same-breed cohort of dogs with or without periodontal disease. Frederiksenia canicola and Neisseria canis were selected as potential early colonizers of salivary pellicle, and Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gulae were included as high incidence canine oral bacteria. N. canis formed a biofilm substratum under aerobic conditions, but was unable to tolerate anaerobic conditions. Fr. canicola exhibited synergistic biofilm growth with Po. gulae under anaerobic conditions, but displayed an antagonistic relationship with Fu. nucleatum. However, strong co-adhesion between Fu. nucleatum and Po. gulae was able to overcome the inhibitory effects of Fr. canicola to facilitate three-species biofilm formation. Parvimonas micra, an anaerobic, asaccharolytic Gram-positive coccus found only under disease conditions in vivo, was able to form biofilms in conjunction with Fr. canicola and Po. gulae. Furthermore, the specific proteolytic activities of biofilms containing Fr. canicola and Po. gulae or Fu. nucleatum and Po. gulae were increased several-fold upon the addition of Pa. micra. This suggests that anaerobic cocci such as Pa. micra might provide a catalyst for progressive tissue destruction, inflammation and alveolar bone loss in canine periodontal disease, in keeping with the keystone-pathogen hypothesis. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

To extract these antibiotic residues, acetonitrile, methanol and a small amount of formic acid were used as solvents. Determination of the antibiotics after extraction steps was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique. The results showed that 14 and 3 samples of Pangasius catfish products were contaminated with enrofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, respectively. No flumequine residue was found. While the concentration levels of these antibiotics in most contaminated samples were lower than the European Union (EU) standard, one sample was found to contain sulfamethoxazole at 245.91 µg kg−1, which was higher than the EU standard (100 µg kg−1), indicating the likelihood that some contaminated freshwater fish products are widely distributed in Thai markets. Notably, the concentration levels of enrofloxacin in samples of Pangasius catfish with skin were higher than in non-skin products, suggesting that products with skin might retain more antibiotic residues than non-skin products. Although the hazard quotient showed that consuming imported Pangasius catfish products, based on the current consumption rate, will not adversely affect consumer health, antibiotic residues in Pangasius catfish products imported into Thailand should be continually monitored. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Antibiotics; ASEAN countries; enrofloxacin; food safety; LC-MS/MS; Pangasius catfish products; sulfamethoxazole; Thailand,"Antibiotics; Food safety; Health; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Organic solvents; Risk assessment; ASEAN countries; Enrofloxacin; LC-MS/MS; Pangasius catfish products; Sulfamethoxazole; Thailand; Health risks; antibiotics; concentration (composition); European Union; extraction method; food safety; formic acid; health risk; mass spectrometry; risk assessment; solvent; teleost; Thailand; Pangasius; antiinfective agent; enrofloxacin; flumequine; fresh water; quinolone derivative; sulfamethoxazole; analysis; animal; catfish; fish product; food analysis; food contamination; human; liquid chromatography; procedures; risk assessment; skin; tandem mass spectrometry; Thailand; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Catfishes; Chromatography, Liquid; Fish Products; Fluoroquinolones; Food Analysis; Food Contamination; Fresh Water; Humans; Risk Assessment; Skin; Sulfamethoxazole; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Thailand",Article

The liver X receptor (LXR) has been reported to regulate several membrane transporters. It is imperative to investigate whether LXR activation regulates SGLT2-mediated glucose transport in human renal proximal tubular cells. What is the main finding and its importance? Liver X receptor activation inhibits SGLT2 transport function in normal and high-glucose conditions via reduction of SGLT2 protein expression. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of a nuclear receptor family consisting of two isoforms, LXRα and LXRβ. They play a major role in energy metabolism, including lipid and glucose metabolism. Recent studies reported that LXRs regulate plasma glucose, although the mechanism is still uncertain. The present study investigated whether LXR activation regulates sodium glucose cotransporter2 (SGLT2) in human renal proximal tubular cells. LXR agonists, T0901317 and GW3965, inhibited SGLT2-mediated glucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of T0901317 and GW3965 was attenuated by a LXR antagonist, fenofibrate. Activation of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, bexarotene, potentiates the inhibitory effect of these ligands. Thus, the inhibitory effect of LXR agonists on SGLT2 was mediated and facilitated by LXR and RXR activation, respectively. In addition, the inhibitory effect of LXR agonists was not mediated by cytotoxicity. Exposing HK-2 cells, a renal proximal tubular cell line, to LXR agonists significantly reduced the maximal transport rate of SGLT2 without any effect on transporter affinity. Western blot analysis revealed that LXR activation significantly decreased protein expression of SGLT2 with no change in mRNA level. In addition, LXR activation inhibited canagliflozin-sensitive short-circuit current, which represents SGLT2-mediated glucose transport in a polarized human renal proximal tubular cell monolayer. Furthermore, LXR activation inhibited the transport function of SGLT2 in hyperglycaemic conditions. As such, this study represents evidence for the inhibitory effect of LXR activation on glucose transport in human renal proximal tubular cells. © 2017 The Authors.

We investigated the prevalence and factors associated with XDR-PA infections, including the factors that predict mortality. Methods We retrospectively studied a cohort of adult, hospitalized patients with P. aeruginosa (PA) infections between April and December 2014. Results Of the 255 patients with PA infections, 56 (22%) were due to XDR-PA, 32 (12.5%) to multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA), and 167 (65.5%) to non-MDR PA. Receiving total parenteral nutrition (adjusted OR [aOR] 6.21; 95% CI 1.05–36.70), prior carbapenem use (aOR 4.88; 95% CI 2.36–10.08), and prior fluoroquinolone use (aOR 3.38; 95% CI 1.44–7.97) were independently associated with the XDR-PA infections. All XDR-PA remained susceptible to colistin. Factors associated with mortality attributable to the infections were the presence of sepsis/septic shock (aOR 11.60; 95% CI 4.66–28.82), admission to a medical department (aOR 4.67; 95% CI 1.81–12.06), receiving a central venous catheter (aOR 3.78; 95% CI 1.50–9.57), and XDR-PA infection (aOR 2.73; 95% CI 1.05–7.08). Conclusion The prevalence of XDR-PA infections represented almost a quarter of Pseudomonas aeruginosa hospital-acquired infections and rendered a higher mortality. The prompt administration of an appropriate empirical antibiotic should be considered when an XDR-PA infection is suspected. © 2018 Palavutitotai et al.

While computed tomography is the gold standard for evaluation of vascular calcification, plain radiograph offers a simpler and less costly alternative. The calcification of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries has been evaluated by plain radiograph, but the data on their outcome predictabilities are still limited. The present study investigated the role of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2–5 (CKD 2–5), maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT) patients. Methods: Four hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and pelvic radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was evaluated according to the methods described previously by Kaupplia et al. and Adragao et al. Patients were followed prospectively for 5 years. Results: AAC and PAC scores correlated well with the correlation coefficients of 0.442 for CKD 2–5, 0.438 for HD and 0.586 for KT (p < 0.001). Patients with AAC score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were older, showed higher prevalence of DM and had higher serum phosphate and PTH but lower serum albumin and eGFR. A more severe degree of AAC was associated with an increase in KT duration, whereas a more severe degree of PAC was associated with worsening kidney function and prolonged dialysis vintage. Kaplan–Meier survival curves revealed AAC score > 6 as a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in CKD 2–5 but not in HD or KT, whereas PAC score > 1 was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in all three populations. After adjusting for age, the predictability of AAC was lost, whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of mortality in all three populations. Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk factors including age, gender, BMI, DM, serum albumin, calcium and phosphate attenuated the predictability of PAC in HD but not in CKD 2–5 or KT patients. Conclusion: PAC was better than AAC in predicting mortality in CKD, HD and KT patients. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Coronary; ESRD; Intimal; Medial; Renal; Transplantation,calcium; phosphate; serum albumin; abdominal aorta calcification; abdominal radiography; adult; age; all cause mortality; artery calcification; Article; body mass; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney failure; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; disease severity; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; femoral artery; follow up; gender; hemodialysis; human; iliac artery; kidney dysfunction; kidney transplantation; major clinical study; male; mortality; pelvic artery calcification; pelvis radiography; phosphate blood level; prediction; radiography; risk factor; treatment outcome,Article

The recently introduced UriSed 3 has a new automated digital imaging urine sediment analyzer with a phase contrast feature. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the UriSed 3 and UX-2000 automated urine sediment analyzers with each other and with the results of the manual microscopic method. Methods: Two hundred seventy-seven (277) samples of leftover fresh urine from our hospital's central laboratory were evaluated by two automated urine sediment analyzers—UriSed 3 and UX-2000. The results of urine sediment analysis were compared between the two automated analyzers and against the results of the manual microscopic method. Results: Both devices demonstrated excellent agreement for quantitative measurement of red blood cells and white blood cells. UX-2000 had a lower coefficient correlation and demonstrated slightly lower agreement for squamous epithelial cells. Regarding semiquantitative analysis, both machines demonstrated very good concordance, with all applicable rates within one grade difference of the other machine. UriSed 3 had higher sensitivity for small round cells, while UX-2000 showed greater sensitivity for detecting bacteria and hyaline casts. UriSed 3 demonstrated slightly better specificity, especially in the detection of hyaline and pathological casts. Conclusions: Both instruments had nearly similar performance for red blood cells and white blood cells measurement.

The VacA toxin contains 2 major domains, p33 and p55, which are involved in receptor binding and membrane pore formation, respectively. Improved methodologies for VacA purification and assays are urgently needed for further detailed investigations on the mechanism of action of this significant virulence factor. We found that by fusing mouse DHFR with the N-terminus of the full-length (p88) VacA toxin, expression levels in recombinant E. coli were substantially increased when compared to the conventional (His)6-tagged protein. The DHFR-VacA fusion protein was active in sulforhodamine dye-release assays using liposomes at acidic pH in a concentration-dependent manner. Enzymatic activity of DHFR in the fusion protein was comparable to a commercial reference sample of purified DHFR; however, activity was insensitive to inhibition by methotrexate.

This study aims to investigate the factors that predict complete pain relief after MVD for treatment of TGN, and to study efficacy and safety in older patients. Methods: This study was conducted in patients with TGN that were treated by MVD at Siriraj Hospital between 2004 and 2015. Cases with secondary TGN were excluded. Data was gathered from medical records, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, intraoperative findings, and by telephone in patients lost to follow-up. Results: Of 110 included patients, 68 and 42 patients were younger and older than 60 years, respectively. Median age was 53.6 years old. Typical type of TGN, paroxysmal pain, large offending vessel on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, and multiple locations of trigeminal nerve compression were associated with early postoperative pain-free status. No variables were associated with long-term outcome. Multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression revealed typical type of TGN to be the only factor associated with early postoperative pain-free status. No significant difference was observed between the <60 and ≥60 age groups for surgical outcome and rate of complications. Conclusions: Presence of typical type TGN was the only factor found to independently predict a pain-free outcome in the early postoperative period. No factors were associated long-term pain-free outcome. MVD is an effective and safe operative procedure, and it should be regarded as a safe and viable alternative for treating intractable TGN in older patients. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Complete pain relief; Factors; Microvascular decompression (MVD); Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN),adult; aged; analgesia; Article; comparative study; controlled study; delirium; face pain; facial nerve paralysis; female; follow up; groups by age; hearing impairment; human; intraoperative period; liquorrhea; major clinical study; male; medical record; microvascular decompression; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; patient safety; postoperative pain; prediction; seizure; subdural hematoma; trigeminus neuralgia; urine retention; wound infection,Article

Methods This retrospective review was conducted with adult patients with intestinal failure who received HPN from October 2002 to April 2014, at Ramathibodi Home Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Referral Center in Bangkok. Results Seventy-two patients (45.8% male, mean age 56.2 ± 15.7 y) were included in the analysis. Incidence of CRBSIs was 1.47 per 1000 catheter days. Over the 12-y period, there were 21 CRBSIs among 10 patients. There were 26 pathogens isolated from these CRBSIs, mostly coagulase-negative staphylococci. Univariate Poisson regression analysis revealed that the incidence rate ratio of CRBSIs was significantly higher in patients who used an implanted port (compared with tunneled catheter), alcohol-based povidone–iodine solution as disinfectant (compared with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol), cyclic HPN infusion (compared with continuous HPN), and hospital-based compound HPN formulations (compared with 3-in-1 commercial formulations). Furthermore, longer duration of HPN (>250 d) was associated with CRBSIs. Multivariate analysis revealed that longer duration of HPN, cyclic HPN, and hospital-based compound HPN were significantly associated with CRBSIs. Conclusions CRBSI is a significant complication in patients receiving long-term HPN. Individualized therapy with a multidisciplinary team in centers with HPN management expertise is required. Careful selection of the catheter type and HPN formulation for each patient is necessary to best meet patient requirements and minimize HPN-related complications. Strict compliance by patients and caregivers with evidence-based instructions together with supervision by well-trained HPN providers is the most effective strategy to prevent CRBSIs. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Bloodstream infection; Catheter-related bloodstream infection; Catheter-related complications; Central line–associated bloodstream infection; Central venous catheter; Home parenteral nutrition; Total parenteral nutrition,2 propanol; alcohol; chlorhexidine gluconate; povidone iodine; adult; Article; catheter infection; coagulase negative Staphylococcus; controlled study; female; home parenteral nutrition; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; Thailand; treatment duration,Article

Tricyclic antidepressants alter visceral hypersensitivity and brain–gut interaction. We assessed the efficacy and safety of nortriptyline in patients with FD. Methods: Patients diagnosed with FD according to Rome III criteria who failed to respond to proton pump inhibitor and prokinetic treatment were randomly assigned to either once daily 10-mg nortriptyline or placebo. The primary endpoint was the rate of responders defined as > 50% reduction in dyspepsia symptom score after 8 weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints were improvement in quality of life as assessed by 36-Item Short Form Health Survey score and safety. Results: Sixty-one patients (nortriptyline 28 and placebo 33) were enrolled. Dyspepsia symptom score and duration of symptoms were balanced at entry between both groups. Eight and seven patients in nortriptyline and placebo groups were lost to follow up. Seven patients withdrew due to mild adverse events (nortriptyline 1 and placebo 6). Overall, 19 with nortriptyline and 20 with placebo completed the study. Patients receiving nortriptyline did not achieve higher response rate than those in placebo in both intention-to-treat (53.6% vs 57.6%, P = 0.75) and per-protocol (76.5% vs 73.7%, P = 1.00) analyses.

It may result in several types of liver problems, including impaired liver regeneration (LR), but the mechanism for this is unknown. Because LR depends on calcium signaling, we examined the effects of NAFLD on expression of the type II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR2), the principle calcium release channel in hepatocytes. ITPR2 promoter activity was measured in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. ITPR2 and c-Jun protein levels were evaluated in Huh7 cells, in liver tissue from a rat model of NAFLD, and in liver biopsy specimens of patients with simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). LR was assessed in wild-type and Itpr2 knockout (Itpr2–/–) mice following 67% hepatectomy. Cell proliferation was examined in ITPR2-knockout HepG2 cells generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. c-Jun dose dependently decreased activity of the human ITPR2 promoter. c-Jun expression was increased and ITPR2 was decreased in fat-loaded Huh7 cells and in livers of rats fed a high-fat, high-fructose diet. Overexpression of c-Jun reduced protein and mRNA expression of ITPR2 in Huh7 cells, whereas knockdown of c-Jun prevented the decrease of ITPR2 in fat-loaded Huh7 cells. ITPR2 expression was decreased and c-Jun was increased in liver biopsies of patients with steatosis and NASH compared to controls. ITPR2-knockout cells exhibited less nuclear calcium signaling and cell proliferation than control cells. LR assessed by Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was markedly decreased in Itpr2–/– mice. Conclusion: Fatty liver induces a c-Jun-mediated decrease in ITPR2 in hepatocytes. This may account for the impaired LR that occurs in NAFLD.

Changes in physicochemical properties of the wastewater including pH, temperature, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total P, TOC, conductivity, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, NO3 −-N, NH3-N, and metal (Pb, Cd, and Zn) concentrations were monitored. In the aquatic plant (AP) treatment, 100% survival of both species was observed. Dry biomass production and growth rate of T. angustifolia were approximately 3.3× and 2.7× of those for E. crassipes, respectively. The extensive root system of the plants improved water quality as determined by a marked decrease in turbidity in the AP treatment after 7 days. BOD content served as a useful indicator of water quality; BOD declined by 91% over 21 days. Both T. angustifolia and E. crassipes accumulated similar quantities of metals in both roots and shoots. Accumulation of metals was as follows: Zn &gt; Cd &gt; Pb. A study of calorific value and biomass composition revealed that T. angustifolia and E. crassipes possessed similar carbon content (~ 35%), hydrogen content (~ 6%), and gross calorific value. E. crassipes contained up to 16.9% ash and 65.4% moisture.

We aimed to assess the validity and response distribution of proSPI and saSPI in patients with psoriasis undergoing phototherapy. Methods: The validity and response distribution of SPI was assessed by recording saSPI and proSPI in patients with psoriasis before and after a course of phototherapy. Recruitment ended once 100 complete data sets were available for analysis. Results: Altogether 52 of the 100 patients evaluated were male and most (93) underwent narrowband UVB phototherapy. There was a close correlation between the proSPI-current severity score (proSPI-s) with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score (r = 0.76, r = 0.86) before and after treatment, respectively. Although pretreatment correlation between the saSPI-current severity score (saSPI-s) and PASI was weak (r = 0.39), a more close correlation was noted at the end of treatment (r = 0.50). A moderate correlation was observed between the SPI-psychosocial impact score (SPI-p) and the dermatology life quality index (DLQI), both before and after phototherapy (r = 0.64, r = 0.73). The SPI had wide response distributions in all three domains.

Methods: Cancer patients aged ≥70 years scheduled to receive the first cycle of a new chemotherapy regimen were enrolled. On the day of starting chemotherapy, demographic data, performance status (PS), and geriatric parameters were recorded. AEs and chemotherapy modification were recorded. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed at baseline and 3 months after starting chemotherapy or at the end of chemotherapy. Results: We included 151 patients (mean age, 76.4 years) with gastrointestinal (47%), lung (24%), breast (9%), or genitourinary (6%) cancer. All-grade and severe AEs occurred in 83 and 42% of patients, respectively; 51.6% of patients required chemotherapy modification due to toxicities. A higher incidence of severe AEs (71% vs. 39%, p = 0.01) and poorer QOL was found in patients with PS 2 than in those with PS 0-1. Patients with PS 2 or who received palliative-intent chemotherapy or had multiple comorbidities were more likely to discontinue chemotherapy because of toxicity. Conclusions: PS remains a key predictor of chemotherapy-related toxicity in elderly patients.

However, IVMP non-responders/PLEX responders showed continuous and maximum improvement at 6 months (ΔEDSS from nadir: 1 for IVMP-responders vs 0.5 for IVMP non-responders without PLEX vs 2.75 IVMP non-responders/PLEX-responders vs 0.5 IVMP/PLEX non-responders; p = 0.49) and had comparable outcomes to the IVMP-responders (nadir EDSS 8.0 to 5.25 [ΔEDSS = 2.75] vs nadir EDSS 6.5 to 5.0; [ΔEDSS = 1.5], respectively). Conclusion: Add - on PLEX treatment in NMOSD patients with an acute attack should be considered in those not responding to IVMP alone. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Acute attack; Add-on therapy; Methylprednisolone; Neuromyelitis optica; Plasma exchange; Treatment response,methylprednisolone; adult; Article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; Expanded Disability Status Scale; female; hospital discharge; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; myelooptic neuropathy; outcome assessment; plasma exchange; Rankin scale; retrospective study; treatment duration; treatment response,Article

Despite the poor prognosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), due to the inevitable development of drug resistance, metabolic reprograming of MCL cells remains an unexplored area. Posttranslational modification of proteins via O-GlcNAcylation is an ideal sensor for nutritional changes mediated byO-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and is removed byO-GlcNAcase (OGA). Using various small-molecule inhibitors of OGT and OGA, we found for the first time that O-GlcNAcylation potentiates MCL response to bortezomib. CRISPR interference of MGEA5 (encoding OGA) validated the apoptosis sensitization by OGlcNAcylation and OGA inhibition. To identify the potential clinical candidates, we tested MCL response to drug-like OGA inhibitor, ketoconazole, and verified that it exerts similar sensitizing effect on bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Investigations into the underlying molecular mechanisms reveal that bortezomib and ketoconazole act in concert to cause the accumulation of truncated Bid (tBid). Not only does ketoconazole potentiate tBid induction, but also increases tBid stability through O-GlcNAcylation that interferes with tBid ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Remarkably, ketoconazole strongly enhances bortezomib-induced apoptosis in de novo bortezomib-resistant MCL cells and in patient-derived primary cells with minimal cytotoxic effect on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and hepatocytes, suggesting its potential utility as a safe and effective adjuvant for MCL. Together, our findings provide novel evidence that combination of bortezomib and ketoconazole or other OGA inhibitors may present a promising strategy for the treatment of drug-resistant MCL. © 2017 AACR.",,bortezomib; caspase 8; ketoconazole; n acetylglucosaminyltransferase; short hairpin RNA; acylation; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer prognosis; cancer resistance; cell death; cell survival; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; comparative study; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug potency; drug potentiation; drug safety; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; gene knockdown; human; human cell; human tissue; JeKo-1 cell line; liver cell; mantle cell lymphoma; mantle cell lymphoma cell; nuclear reprogramming; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; primary cell; priority journal; protein degradation; protein modification; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; ubiquitination; Western blotting,Article

HPV infections can successfully be prevented by vaccination, which is available at a cost but not yet implemented in the national vaccination program. Parents play a critical role in deciding whether to vaccinate their child against HPV. Thus, the aim was to examine the association between parents’ knowledge, beliefs, and acceptance of the HPV vaccination for their daughters, considering their socio-demographics and religious beliefs. A cross-sectional design was used among three schools in Thailand: Nakorn Phatom province (suburban) and Bangkok (urban). Parents of 9–12-year-old daughters completed the questionnaires, guided by the Health Belief Model. In total, 359 parents completed the questionnaires; of those, 301 were included in the final analyses. The ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis showed that background knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine was positively related to knowledge of HPV and cervical cancer. For beliefs, knowledge was positively associated with susceptibility (i.e., parents’ perceived risk of an HPV infection/ related disease), severity, and benefit. However, knowledge was not significantly related to barriers. For acceptance, higher susceptibility and benefit were related to higher acceptance, and greater knowledge was associated with higher acceptance. Thus, we found associations between parents’ knowledge, beliefs, and acceptance of the HPV vaccination for their daughters, considering their socio-demographics and religious beliefs. Parents, who reported religion as important, as opposed to those who did not, were more favorable toward the HPV vaccination. Four out of ten mothers had never undergone a cervical cancer screening, but most had accepted previous childhood vaccinations for their daughters. The overall acceptance of the vaccine was high, and we believe our results are promising for future implementation of the HPV vaccination in the national childhood vaccination program in Thailand. © 2018 Grandahl et al.

The simulations are performed with an incompressible, pseudo-spectral magnetohydrodynamics code in 2D where we take thick, resistively decaying, current-sheet like sheared magnetic configurations which do not reconnect spontaneously. We describe and test the forcing that is introduced in the momentum equation to drive fluctuations. It is found that the forcing does not change the rate of decay; however, it adds and removes energy faster in the presence of the magnetic shear structure compared to when it has decayed away. We observe that such a forcing can induce magnetic reconnection due to field line wandering leading to the formation of magnetic islands and O-points. These reconnecting field lines spread out as the current sheet decays with time. A semi-empirical formula is derived which reasonably explains the formation and spread of O-points. We find that reconnection spreads faster with stronger forcing and longer correlation time of forcing, while the wavenumber of forcing does not have a significant effect. When the field line wandering becomes large enough, the neighboring current sheets with opposite polarity start interacting, and then the magnetic field is rapidly annihilated. This work is useful to understand how forced fluctuations can drive reconnection in large scale current structures in space and astrophysical plasmas that are not susceptible to reconnection. © 2018 Author(s).",,Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Magnetohydrodynamics; Magnetoplasma; Astrophysical plasma; Large-scale currents; Magnetic configuration; Magnetic field configurations; Magnetic field line; Magnetic reconnections; Momentum equation; Semi-empirical formulas; Magnetic polarity,Article

The primary purpose of such financial information is to accompany a monthly or quarterly report for executives to make sound business decisions and strategies for the next business period. These business strategies often result in transitions that cause underlying infrastructures and components to change, including alteration in the nomenclature system of the business components. As a result, a transaction stream of an affected component would be replaced by another stream with a different component name, resulting in discontinuity of a financial stream of the same component. Recently, advancement in large-scale data mining technologies has enabled a set of critical applications to utilize knowledge extracted from a vast amount of existing data that would otherwise have been unused or underutilized. In financial and services computing domains, recent studies have illustrated that historical financial data could be used to predict future revenues and profits, optimizing costs, among other potential applications. These prediction models rely on long-term availability of the historical data that traces back for multiple years. However, the discontinuity of the financial transaction stream associated with a business component has limited the learning capability of the prediction models. In this article, we propose a set of machine learning-based algorithms to automatically discover component name replacements, using information available in general ledger databases. The algorithms are designed to be scalable for handling massive data points, especially in large companies. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms are generalizable to other domains whose data is time series and shares the same nature as the financial data available in business ledgers. A case study of real-world IBM service delivery retrieved from four different geographical regions is used to validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology. © 2018 ACM.",Classification; Machine learning; Name replacement discovery; Services delivery,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data handling; Data reduction; Finance; Forecasting; Geographical regions; Learning systems; Business decisions; Business transaction; Critical applications; Financial information; Financial transactions; Learning capabilities; Name replacement discovery; Services delivery; Data mining,Article

The screen-printed graphene electrode was used as working electrode providing sensitivity for the sensor. The amperometric detection of AChE is based on the determination of thiocholine (TCh) produced from hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCh) by AChE. To detect TCh, the ATCh immobilized sheet was stacked onto the detection sheet using double adhesive tape, then samples of AChE were dropped on the back side of an ATCh immobilized sheet with only 1 min of incubation time. To avoid interference, glutathione (GSH), the potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied onto a graphene electrode and the current, which depends on AChE concentration, was measured. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) from the experiment of AChE determination was 0.1 U/mL with AChE concentration in range of 0.1–15 U/mL. The data correlated well with the data obtained using spectrophotometric method. The developed sensor had been successfully applied to detect AChE in blood samples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Acetylcholinesterase; Paper-based sensor; Screen-printed graphene electrode,Chemical detection; Chlorine compounds; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Graphene; Graphite electrodes; Spectrophotometry; Acetylcholinesterase; Amperometric detection; ELectrochemical detection; Graphene electrodes; Limit of detection; Optimized conditions; Screen-printed graphene electrodes; Spectro-photometric method; Amperometric sensors,Article

The synthesis involves two simple steps: nucleophilic substitution between benzylchloride functionalized SQ and imidazoyl pyrrolidine carboxylate and subsequent deprotection. The catalyst was isolated by simple filtration. The SQ-supported chiral pyrrolidine catalyst was used as a heterogeneous catalyst in an asymmetric Michael addition into nitrostyrenes under room temperature and neat condition, giving the product in excellent yields (85–91%), diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1) and enantioselectivities (95–98%).

Previous data has suggested that nucleotide composition constraint was the main determinant of HIV codon usage, and that nucleotide composition and codon usage were different between the regulatory genes, tat and rev, and other viral genes. It is not clear whether translational selection contributed to the codon usage difference and how nucleotide composition and translational selection interact to determine HIV codon usage. In this study, a model of codon bias due to GC composition with modification for the A-rich third codon position was used to calculate predicted HIV codon frequencies based on its nucleotide composition. The predicted codon usage of each gene was compared with the actual codon frequency. The predicted codon usage based on GC composition matched well with the actual codon frequencies for the structural genes (gag, pol and env). However, the codon usage of the regulatory genes (tat and rev) could not be predicted. Codon usage of the regulatory genes was also relatively unbiased showing the highest effective number of codons (ENC). Moreover, the codon adaptation index (CAI) of the regulatory genes showed better adaptation to human codons when compared to other HIV genes. Therefore, the early expressed genes responsible for regulation of the replication cycle, tat and rev, were more similar to humans in terms of codon usage and GC content than other HIV genes. This may help these genes to be expressed efficiently during the early stages of infection. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",,nucleotide; viral protein; codon; DNA base composition; genetics; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; metabolism; mutation; virology; Base Composition; Codon; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Mutation; Nucleotides; Viral Proteins,Article

In this review, we present recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of these complications of severe malaria, and discuss future areas of research. Recent findings Cerebral malaria and AKI are serious and well recognized complications of severe malaria. Common pathophysiological pathways include impaired microcirculation, due to sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes, systemic inflammatory responses, and endothelial activation. Recent MRI studies show significant brain swelling in both adults and children with evidence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome-like syndrome although targeted interventions including mannitol and dexamethasone are not beneficial. Recent work shows association of cell-free hemoglobin oxidation stress involved in the pathophysiology of AKI in both adults and children. Paracetamol protected renal function likely by inhibiting cell-free-mediated oxidative stress. It is unclear if heme-mediated endothelial activation or oxidative stress is involved in cerebral malaria. Summary The direct causes of cerebral and kidney dysfunction remain incompletely understood. Optimal treatment involves prompt diagnosis and effective antimalarial treatment with artesunate. Renal replacement therapy reduces mortality in AKI but delayed diagnosis is an issue. © 2018 The Author(s).

Diacerein is an anthraquinone used to treat osteoarthritis that exerts anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the synthesis and activity of proinflammatory cytokines. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of diacerein on renal function and renal organic anion transporter 3 (Oat3) function in obese insulin-resistant condition. Obese insulin-resistant rats were induced by feeding a high-fat diet in male Wistar rats for 16 weeks. Diacerein or metformin (positive control) (30 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 4 weeks after insulin resistance had been confirmed. Obese insulin-resistant rats showed an impaired renal function as indicated by the increased serum creatinine and microalbuminuria along with the decreased renal Oat3 function and expression. Importantly, diacerein treatment not only improved insulin resistance but also restored renal function. The decreased renal malondialdehyde level, expressions of PKCα, angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R), Nrf2, and HO-1, and increased expression of SOD2 were observed in diacerein treatment group, indicating the attenuation of renal oxidative stress condition. Moreover, renal inflammation and renal damage were also alleviated in diacerein-treated rats. Our results demonstrated for the first time that diacerein was effective to improve renal function and renal Oat3 function in obese insulin-resistance condition mediated by suppressing renal oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings suggest that anti-inflammatory agents can be used therapeutically to improve metabolic disorder and prevent organ dysfunctions in pre-diabetic condition. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Diacerein; Inflammation; Insulin resistance; Kidney function; Oxidative stress,angiotensin 1 receptor; creatinine; diacerein; heme oxygenase 1; malonaldehyde; manganese superoxide dismutase; metformin; organic anion transporter 3; protein kinase C alpha; transcription factor Nrf2; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; Article; controlled study; creatinine blood level; drug effect; inflammation; insulin resistance; kidney dysfunction; kidney function; kidney injury; lipid diet; male; microalbuminuria; nephritis; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; rat; renal protection; treatment duration,Article

Methods In a single province, we surveyed eight farms in which chickens were raised for meat and interviewed the farms’ owners in 2016. The antibiotic use for each chicken was defined as the amount of antibiotic given to the chicken over its entire lifetime divided by the target weight of the chicken at the time of its slaughter. Assuming that the results were nationally representative, we estimated annual antibiotic use on all Thai chickens raised for meat. Findings No use of antibiotics for growth promotion was reported. Five farms raised 1-kg chickens for company A and reportedly used no antibiotics unless the chickens were sick. The other three farms raised 3-kg chickens for company B and reported routine use of antibiotics for prophylaxis. Per kg final weight, each chicken raised for company B was reportedly routinely given a mean of 101 mg of antibiotics – that is, 33 mg of amoxicillin, 29 mg colistin, 19 mg oxytetracycline, 18 mg doxycycline and 2 mg tilmicosin. The total amount of antibiotic used on all Thai chickens raised for meat in 2016 was estimated to be 161 tonnes. Conclusion Each year in Thailand, many tonnes of antibiotics are probably routinely used in raising chickens for meat.

THA patients continue to experience symptoms, most commonly pain, which prevent their return to full function and activity. Possible causes include failure of fixation, instability and damage to soft tissues, associated with the trauma of the surgical procedure. Choosing the optimal surgical approach can minimize these risks and therefore improve the outcome of THA. Surgical approaches in THA include anterior, lateral [anterolateral (Hardinge) and direct lateral (Watson–Jones)], posterior (posterolateral and posterior) and posterior-2 techniques. However, there is no current consensus regarding which approach is the most suitable. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare the postoperative outcomes and complications among THA approach and identify which approach is the best for THA. We searched all RCT studies that compared intra-operative and postoperative outcomes of anterior, lateral [anterolateral (Hardinge) and direct lateral (Watson–Jones)], posterior (posterolateral and posterior) and posterior-2 approaches for THA from the PubMed and Scopus databases up to February 1, 2017. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers. A network meta-analysis was applied to assess treatment outcomes. Probability of being the best treatment was estimated using surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA). Fourteen RCTs (N = 1017 patients) met inclusion criteria. Interventions were anterior (N = 233 patients), lateral (N = 334 patients), posterior (N = 405 patients) and posterior-2 (N = 45 patients) approaches. A network meta-analysis showed that effects of anterior approach were higher to lateral, posterior and posterior-2 approaches with the pooled mean postoperative within 1 month and last follow-up of HHS of 2.56 (95% CI − 0.79, 5.91), 4.80 (95% CI 1.33, 8.26), 10.80 (95% CI 2.10, 19.49) and 6.40 (95% CI 0.72, 12.09), 2.22 (95% CI − 3.21, 7.66), 4.22 (95% CI − 6.81, 15.25), respectively. For VAS, lateral approach was lower to anterior, posterior and posterior-2 approaches. In terms of complication, posterior approach was the lowest risk with RR of 0.39 (95% CI 0.19, 0.81), 0.57 (95% CI 0.21, 1.57) and 1.74 (95% CI 0.36, 8.33) when compared to anterior, followed by lateral and posterior-2 approaches.

Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for melioidosis, and the global diabetes pandemic could increase the number of fatalities caused by melioidosis. Melioidosis is endemic across tropical areas, especially in southeast Asia and northern Australia. Disease manifestations can range from acute septicaemia to chronic infection, as the facultative intracellular lifestyle and virulence factors of B. pseudomallei promote survival and persistence of the pathogen within a broad range of cells, and the bacteria can manipulate the host's immune responses and signalling pathways to escape surveillance. The majority of patients present with sepsis, but specific clinical presentations and their severity vary depending on the route of bacterial entry (skin penetration, inhalation or ingestion), host immune function and bacterial strain and load. Diagnosis is based on clinical and epidemiological features as well as bacterial culture. Treatment requires long-term intravenous and oral antibiotic courses. Delays in treatment due to difficulties in clinical recognition and laboratory diagnosis often lead to poor outcomes and mortality can exceed 40% in some regions. Research into B. pseudomallei is increasing, owing to the biothreat potential of this pathogen and increasing awareness of the disease and its burden; however, better diagnostic tests are needed to improve early confirmation of diagnosis, which would enable better therapeutic efficacy and survival. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Therefore, range defensibility can help us understand the spatial structure of animal territoriality. We used howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.), a genus for which no agreement on the extent of their territoriality exists, to investigate the factors mediating range defensibility. We compared the defensibility index (D) across 63 groups of howler monkeys, representing 8 different species, based on a literature review. All species, except Alouatta palliata, were classified as potentially territorial according to D, although there was high variability within and among species. Group size had a positive effect on D, probably owing to the greater ability of groups to defend a territory as they become larger. Study area had a negative effect on D, perhaps suggesting that unlike small areas, large areas allow groups to have territories that do not require significant defense from neighbors. However, population density was the factor with the strongest effect on D, with greater monitoring of home ranges under high levels of competition. Our results suggest that howler monkeys are theoretically capable of maintaining a territory and suggest that animals can show a gradient in territoriality, which can be mediated by the competitive context in which it occurs. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Alouatta; Defensibility index; Ranging costs; Socioecology; Territoriality,competition (ecology); home range; index method; population density; primate; territoriality; territory; Alouatta; Alouatta palliata; Animalia,Article

We evaluated predictors of chronic kidney disease 5 years and nonrenal cancer mortality 10 years after renal cancer surgery. Materials and Methods We analyzed the records of 4,283 patients who underwent renal cancer surgery from 1997 to 2008. Radical and partial nephrectomy were performed in 46% and 54% of patients, respectively. Cumulative probability ordinal modeling was used to predict chronic kidney disease status 5 years after surgery and multivariable logistic regression was used to predict nonrenal cancer mortality at 10 years. Relevant patient, tumor and functional covariates were incorporated, including the preoperative glomerular filtration rate (A), the new baseline glomerular filtration rate after surgery (B) and the glomerular filtration rate loss related to surgery (C), that is C = A – B. In contrast, partial or radical nephrectomy was not used in the models due to concerns about strong selection bias associated with the choice of procedure. Results Multivariable modeling established the preoperative glomerular filtration rate and the glomerular filtration rate loss related to surgery as the most important predictors of the development of chronic kidney disease (Spearman ρ = 0.78). Age, gender and race had secondary roles. Significant predictors of 10-year nonrenal cancer mortality were the preoperative glomerular filtration rate, the new baseline glomerular filtration rate, age, diabetes and heart disease (all p <0.05). Multivariable modeling established age and the preoperative glomerular filtration rate as the most important predictors of 10-year nonrenal cancer mortality (c-index 0.71) while the glomerular filtration rate loss related to surgery only changed absolute mortality estimates 1% to 3%. Conclusions Glomerular filtration rate loss related to renal cancer surgery, whether due to partial or radical nephrectomy, influences the risk of chronic kidney disease but it may have less impact on survival. In contrast, age and the preoperative glomerular filtration rate, which reflects general health status, are more robust predictors of nonrenal cancer mortality, at least in patients with good preoperative function or mild chronic kidney disease. © 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",chronic; glomerular filtration rate; kidney failure; kidney neoplasms; mortality; nephrectomy,creatinine; adult; age; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chronic kidney failure; clinical evaluation; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; glomerulus filtration rate; heart disease; human; hypertension; kidney cancer; kidney function; long term survival; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; outcome assessment; partial nephrectomy; priority journal; race; radical nephrectomy; selection bias,Article

Cultured ASC sheets provide a novel method of ASC application and can retain ASCs at the targeted tissue. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate preclinical studies using ASC sheet transplantation therapy for promoting tissue healing. First, we searched databases to identify studies of ASC sheet therapy in different experimental animal models, and then determined the quality score of studies using SYRCLE's risk bias tool. A total of 18 included studies examined the role of ASC sheets on tissue healing and function in models for myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, full-thickness skin wounds, hind limb ischemia, esophageal strictures, and oral ulcers. ASC sheet application after myocardial infarction improved survival rate, cardiac function, and capillary density and reduced the extent of fibrosis. Application of ASC sheets to a full-thickness skin wound decreased the wound size and stimulated wound maturation. In the hind limb ischemia model, ASC sheet application improved limb perfusion and capillary density, and decreased the amount of ischemic tissue and inflammation. ASC sheet application to mucosal wounds of the digestive tract accelerated wound healing and decreased the degree of stricture and fibrosis. Taken together, transplanted ASC sheets had a positive effect on tissue healing and reconstruction in these preclinical studies. The reported favorable effects of ASC sheet therapy in various tissue healing applications may be implemented in future translational studies. It is suggested that future preclinical animal model studies of ASC sheet therapy should concern standardization of culture techniques and investigate the mechanisms of action. In addition, clearly indicated experimental setups according to the SYRCLE's guidelines should improve study quality and validity. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.",adipose tissue-derived stem cells; cell sheet; in vivo; tissue healing; transplantation,Animals; Cardiology; Cells; Cytology; Physiological models; Stem cells; Transplantation (surgical); Adipose tissue; Adipose tissuederived stem cell (ASCs); Cell sheet; Dilated cardiomyopathy; In-vivo; Myocardial Infarction; Tissue healing; Transplantation therapy; Tissue; adiponectin; collagen type 1; epidermal growth factor; fibroblast growth factor 2; fibronectin; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; polystyrene; scatter factor; somatomedin B; somatomedin C; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin; adipose tissue; adipose tissue derived stem cell; capillary density; cardiac muscle; cell density; cell survival; congestive cardiomyopathy; digestive system injury; esophagus stenosis; gene overexpression; healing; heart function; heart infarction; heart muscle fibrosis; heart tissue; hindlimb; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; limb ischemia; maturation; mouth ulcer; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; preclinical study; priority journal; Review; skin injury; stem cell; survival rate; systematic review; tissue regeneration; transplantation; vascularization; wound closure; wound healing,Review

A nationwide multi-institutional registry was conducted to compare the histopathology, clinical features, and survival of Thai adult patients with NHL using large registries, especially those from Far East Asia (FEA). Using a web-based registry system, 13 major medical centers from the 4 geographic regions of Thailand prospectively collected, from 2007 to 2014, the diagnostic pathology, according to the World Health Organization classification, 2008, clinical features and survival of 4056 patients who were newly diagnosed with NHL. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range, 16-99 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.3:1. From the total of 4056 patients, T/NK-cell lymphoma (TNKCL) accounted for 12.6% of cases, and 5.1% had human immunodeficiency virus–associated lymphoma. The four leading histological subtypes were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (58.1%); follicular lymphoma (5.6%); extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (5.2%); and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (4.0%). With a median follow-up duration of 46.1 months, the median overall survival of B-cell NHL was significantly longer than that of patients with TNKCL (76.5 vs 28.8 months, P =.0001). Compared to FEA, the Thai registry had an approximately one-half lower relative frequency of TNKCL; the prevalence of extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma was much lower than in Korea, and the frequency of extranodal TNKCL, nasal type, was strikingly low compared to China. It is concluded that while the median age of Thai patients with NHL was approximately a decade younger than for Caucasians, the long-term survival rates for most histological subtypes were comparable. While the histological distribution generally complied with the characteristic Asian features, some differences from FEA were observed.

Light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been extensively used in portable analytical devices as they are exceptionally stable light sources offering a number of advantages over traditional light sources including robustness, small size and low-cost. In the analytically more significant deep UV spectral range, LEDs suffer from low optical power and parasitic emissions in the visible wavelength range. Recently, newly developed deep UV-LEDs based on aluminium nitride (AlN) substrates have been introduced claiming improved performance, however there is little in terms of systematic evaluation of their performance parameters when used as light sources in chemical sciences. The aim of this work was to investigate the performance of these new generation deep UV‐LEDs, and assess their analytical applicability. Three AlN substrate based LEDs (OPTAN255H, OPTAN255J and OPTAN280J) were selected based on their maximum emission wavelength and maximum optical power. Their emission spectra, optical output power values and energy conversion efficiency (electrical/optical) were investigated. This work shows effects of forward current and voltages on the ratio of intensities of the visible parasitic emission to the desirable deep UV emission. Experimental results show that while the parasitic emission still exists with the new generation deep UV-LEDs, with increasing forward current the ratio of undesirable parasitic emission to the main deep UV emission rapidly decreased to values as low as 0.1% at the maximum forward current (100 mA). The new generation deep UV-LED (255 nm) was then applied as a light source for a photometric on-capillary detection, showing excellent linearity with stray light down to 0.8%, and effective pathlength above 92% of the used capillary inner diameter, and finally the performance was demonstrated by detection of four parabens separated by miniaturised capillary liquid chromatography. © 2017",Analytical separations; Deep UV spectral range; Light emitting diodes (LEDs); Optical detection; Portable analytical instrumentation,Aluminum nitride; Analytic equipment; Chromatography; Conversion efficiency; Emission spectroscopy; Energy conversion; Light sources; Liquid chromatography; Stray light; Substrates; Analytical Instrumentation; Analytical separations; Capillary liquid chromatography; Deep uv; Optical detection; Optical detection system; Optical Instrumentation; Visible-wavelength range; Light emitting diodes,Article

However, there is a paucity of data on infection among pigs in many parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia. We aimed to estimate seroprevalence of porcine cysticercosis, and investigate husbandary practices and knowledge of the disease among livestock workers, across different pig sector units in south-central Cambodia. Methods A cross sectional survey was conducted among pig smallholders, commercial farms, slaughterhouses and traders/middlemen from south-central Cambodia, selected through multistage sampling in proportion to local pig populations sizes. Questionnaires were administered to 163 pig workers to obtain data pig production, trading and slaughtering practices. Sera from 620 pigs were tested for Taenia antigens using a commercial ELISA-based test. Associations between seroprevalence and pig husbandry practices were assessed using generalised linear mixed models, adjusting for random-effects at herd-level. Results Of 620 pigs sampled, 29 (4.7%) tested positive for Taenia antigens. Seropositivity was associated with type of pig sector unit (P = 0.008), with the highest seroprevalence among pigs sampled from traders/middlemen (16.7%; 95% CI: 4.4%–37.8%), smallholders (7.6%; 95% CI: 3.8%–14.1%) and slaughterhouses (4.1%; 95% CI: 2.0%–7.5%), while none of the pigs sampled from small/medium or large commercial farms tested positive. Although the vast majority of pigs were penned, practices that might facilitate human-to-pig transmission, such as use of household waste and surface water sources to feed pigs, were prevalent among smallholders. However these were not found to be significantly associated with infection. Of 163 interviewed pig workers, 115 (70.5%) were aware of porcine cysticercosis, and 78 (47.8%) also knew it could affect humans. Twenty-six (16.0%) reported having noticed lesions typical of cysticercosis in their pigs. Conclusions Despite most pigs being kept confined in pens rather than raised in free-roaming systems, porcine cysticercosis appears to be endemic in south-central Cambodia and is associated with smallholder production. Further investigation is needed to identify which Taenia species are causing infections among pigs, and how seroprevalence and zoonotic risk may vary across the country, to understand the risks to public health and assess where interventions might be needed. © 2017",Cambodia; Livestock production; Pigs; Porcine cysticercosis; Taenia; Zoonosis,surface water; agricultural worker; animal husbandry; antigen detection; Article; Cambodia; cross-sectional study; cysticercosis; disease association; domestic waste; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; livestock; nonhuman; parasite transmission; porcine cysticercosis; questionnaire; seroprevalence; slaughterhouse; swine disease; Taenia; zoonosis,Article

Varying patterns of food allergy are seen even within Asian countries—such as a predominance of wheat allergy in Japan and Thailand and shellfish allergy in Singapore and the Philippines. Customs and traditions, such as diet and infant feeding practices, also differ between Asian populations. Hence, there are unique challenges in adapting guidelines on early allergenic food introduction to the Asian setting.

Method: English language tweets were collected between March 15, 2015 and April 17, 2017, using Twitter API. U.S. geolocated unique (no retweets) tweets were manually coded to evaluate the content of rosin-related tweets. Adjusted proportions of Twitter users and personal communication tweets per state related to rosin concentrates were calculated. A permutation test was used to analyze differences in normalized proportions between U.S. states with different cannabis legal statuses. Results: eDrugTrends collected 8389 tweets mentioning rosin concentrates/technique. 4164 tweets (49.6% of total sample) posted by 1264 unique users had identifiable state-level geolocation. Content analysis of 2010 non-retweeted tweets revealed a high proportion of media-related tweets (44.2%) promoting rosin as a safer and solventless production method. Tweet-volume-adjusted percentages of geolocated Twitter users and personal communication tweets about rosin were respectively up to seven and sixteen times higher between states allowing recreational use of cannabis and states where cannabis is illegal. Conclusion: Our results indicate that there are higher proportions of personal communication tweets and Twitter users tweeting about rosin in U.S. states where cannabis is legalized. Rosin concentrates are advertised as a safer, more natural form of concentrates, but more research on this emerging form of marijuana concentrate is needed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cannabis legislation; Marijuana concentrates; Rosin technique; Social media; Twitter,cannabis; rosin; Article; cannabis use; English (language); geography; interpersonal communication; legal aspect; mobile application; priority journal; social media; United States,Article

TB often affects those from a low socio-economic background. OBJECTIVE : To assess the socio-economic determinants of TB in HIV-infected patients in Asia. DESIGN: This was a matched case-control study. HIVpositive, TB-positive cases were matched to HIVpositive, TB-negative controls according to age, sex and CD4 cell count. A socio-economic questionnaire comprising 23 questions, including education level, employment, housing and substance use, was distributed. Socio-economic risk factors for TB were analysed using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULT S : A total of 340 patients (170 matched pairs) were recruited, with 262 (77.1%) matched for all three criteria. Pulmonary TB was the predominant type (n = 115, 67.6%). The main risk factor for TB was not having a university level education (OR 4.45, 95%CI 1.50-13.17, P=0.007). Burning wood or coal regularly inside the house and living in the same place of origin were weakly associated with TB diagnosis. CONCLUS IONS : These data suggest that lower socioeconomic status is associated with an increased risk of TB in Asia. Integrating clinical and socio-economic factors into HIV treatment may help in the prevention of opportunistic infections and disease progression. © 2018 The Union.",HIV; Matched; Questionnaire; Socio-economic; TB,coal; academic achievement; adult; age; Article; Asia; case control study; CD4 lymphocyte count; controlled study; disease association; disease exacerbation; educational status; employment status; environmental exposure; female; health survey; housing; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; infection risk; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; priority journal; questionnaire; sex; social status; substance use; treatment outcome; wood dust,Article

Our recent study reported that human Ad5-specific CD4 T cells induced by Ad5 vaccination (RV156A trial) are susceptible to HIV. Here we further investigated the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by ALVAC, a canarypox viral vector tested in the Thai trial RV144, as compared to Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells in the HVTN204 trial. We showed that while Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells were readily susceptible to HIV, ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. The lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells was associated with the reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Phenotypic analyses identified that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-1β) but little IL-17. Of interest, ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in PBMC, with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation, while Ad5 vector induced CD4 T-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALVAC-, but not Ad5-, induced CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV.

To evaluate the existing AR literature, international multidisciplinary experts with an interest in AR have produced the International Consensus statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Allergic Rhinitis (ICAR:AR). Methods: Using previously described methodology, specific topics were developed relating to AR. Each topic was assigned a literature review, evidence-based review (EBR), or evidence-based review with recommendations (EBRR) format as dictated by available evidence and purpose within the ICAR:AR document. Following iterative reviews of each topic, the ICAR:AR document was synthesized and reviewed by all authors for consensus. Results: The ICAR:AR document addresses over 100 individual topics related to AR, including diagnosis, pathophysiology, epidemiology, disease burden, risk factors for the development of AR, allergy testing modalities, treatment, and other conditions/comorbidities associated with AR. Conclusion: This critical review of the AR literature has identified several strengths; providers can be confident that treatment decisions are supported by rigorous studies. However, there are also substantial gaps in the AR literature. These knowledge gaps should be viewed as opportunities for improvement, as often the things that we teach and the medicine that we practice are not based on the best quality evidence. This document aims to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the AR literature to identify areas for future AR research and improved understanding. © 2018 ARS-AAOA, LLC",allergen extract; allergen immunotherapy; allergic rhinitis; allergy; antihistamine; asthma; atopic dermatitis; avoidance; biologic; cockroach; conjunctivitis; consensus; corticosteroid; cough; cromolyn; decongestant; environment; eosinophilic esophagitis; epicutaneous immunotherapy; epidemiology; evidence-based medicine; food allergy; genetics; house dust mite; IgE; immunoglobulin E; immunotherapy; inhalant allergy; leukotriene; microbiome; occupational rhinitis; omalizumab; pathophysiology; perennial; pet dander; pollen; probiotic; quality of life; rhinitis; rhinitis; rhinosinusitis; risk factor; saline; seasonal; sensitization; sinusitis; sleep; socioeconomic; specific IgE; subcutaneous immunotherapy; sublingual immunotherapy; systematic review; total IgE; transcutaneous immunotherapy; validated survey,allergen; antihistaminic agent; corticosteroid; cromoglycate disodium; decongestive agent; immunoglobulin E; omalizumab; probiotic agent; adenoid hypertrophy; age distribution; age related rhinitis; alcohol induced rhinitis; allergic rhinitis; allergy test; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atrophic rhinitis; auditory tube dysfunction; autoimmune disease; basophil activation test; breast feeding; chemical rhinitis; cockroach; comorbidity; component resolved diagnosis; conjunctivitis; Dermatophagoides; differential diagnosis; disease association; disease burden; disease classification; disease severity; drug therapy; empty nose syndrome; endoscopy; environmental exposure; eosinophilic esophagitis; epigenetics; evidence based medicine; food allergy; food induced rhinitis; genotype environment interaction; geographic distribution; granulomatosis; heredity; histopathology; hormonally induced rhinitis; human; immunoglobulin blood level; incidence; infectious rhinitis; inflammatory infiltrate; inner ear disease; medical literature; microbiome; mite; molecular diagnosis; nasal endoscopy; non allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome; nonhuman; occupational allergy; occupational rhinitis; otitis media; otorhinolaryngology; pathophysiology; perennial rhinitis; physical examination; pollen; pollen allergy; pollution; prevalence; prick test; priority journal; rhinitis; rhinitis medicamentosa; rhinorrhea; rhinosinusitis; risk factor; sarcoidosis; sensitization; single nucleotide polymorphism; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; smoke induced rhinitis; socioeconomics; subcutaneous immunotherapy; sublingual immunotherapy; systematic review; treatment outcome; vasomotor rhinitis; Wegener granulomatosis,Article

Several studies have reported on the proteomics of BR and GBR; however, the proteomic profiles related to the synthesis of bioactive compounds are less well documented. In the present study, BR and GBR were used in a comparative analysis of the proteomic and bioactive compound profiles for two famous Thai rice varieties: Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML) and Mali Daeng (MD). RESULTS: The proteomes of KDML and MD revealed differences in the expression patterns of proteins after germination. Total phenolic compound content, anthocyanin contents and antioxidant activity of red rice MD was approximately 2.6-, 2.2- and 9.2-fold higher, respectively, compared to that of the white rice KDML. Moreover, GBR of MD showed higher total anthocyanin content and greater antioxidant activity, which is consistent with the increase expression of several proteins involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds and protection against oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: Red rice MD exhibits higher nutrient values compared to white rice KDML and the appropriate germination of brown rice could represent a method for improving health-related benefits. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",anthocyanin; antioxidant; Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML); Mali Daeng (MD); shotgun proteomics,"antioxidant; phenol derivative; plant extract; plant protein; proteome; chemistry; classification; comparative study; germination; growth, development and aging; metabolism; nutritional value; Oryza; plant seed; proteomics; Antioxidants; Germination; Nutritive Value; Oryza; Phenols; Plant Extracts; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Seeds",Article

The objective was to use the oily phase of the system to formulate a liquid, non-aqueous product while obtaining the advantages of self-emulsification, rapid contact with the rectal mucosa and rapid absorption post-administration. Ceftriaxone was used as a model drug and the human bile salt sodium chenodeoxycholate was used as an absorption enhancer. After preliminary screening of 23 excipients, based on their emulsification ability and emulsion fineness in binary and ternary mixtures, a full factorial design was used to screen different formulations of three preselected excipients. The optimal formulation contained 60% of excipients, namely Capryol 90, Kolliphor EL and Kolliphor PS20 in 4: 6: 6 ratio and 40% of a powder blend that included 500 mg of ceftriaxone.

These results may not be reproducible in low or middle-income countries (LMICs), not only because of different case-mix characteristics but also because of missing predictor variables. The study objective was to systematically review literature on the use of critical care prognostic models in LMICs and assess their ability to discriminate between survivors and non-survivors at hospital discharge of those admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), their calibration, their accuracy, and the manner in which missing values were handled. Methods: The PubMed database was searched in March 2017 to identify research articles reporting the use and performance of prognostic models in the evaluation of mortality in ICUs in LMICs. Studies carried out in ICUs in high-income countries or paediatric ICUs and studies that evaluated disease-specific scoring systems, were limited to a specific disease or single prognostic factor, were published only as abstracts, editorials, letters and systematic and narrative reviews or were not in English were excluded. Results: Of the 2233 studies retrieved, 473 were searched and 50 articles reporting 119 models were included. Five articles described the development and evaluation of new models, whereas 114 articles externally validated Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score and Mortality Probability Models or versions thereof. Missing values were only described in 34% of studies; exclusion and or imputation by normal values were used. Discrimination, calibration and accuracy were reported in 94.0%, 72.4% and 25% respectively. Good discrimination and calibration were reported in 88.9% and 58.3% respectively. However, only 10 evaluations that reported excellent discrimination also reported good calibration. Generalisability of the findings was limited by variability of inclusion and exclusion criteria, unavailability of post-ICU outcomes and missing value handling. Conclusions: Robust interpretations regarding the applicability of prognostic models are currently hampered by poor adherence to reporting guidelines, especially when reporting missing value handling. Performance of mortality risk prediction models in LMIC ICUs is at best moderate, especially with limitations in calibration. This necessitates continued efforts to develop and validate LMIC models with readily available prognostic variables, perhaps aided by medical registries. © 2018 The Author(s).",Critical care; ICU scoring system; Low and middle-income countries; Model performance; Prognostic model; Resource-limited settings,APACHE; Article; calibration; high income country; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; intensive care; low income country; measurement accuracy; middle income country; mortality; mortality risk; outcome assessment; pediatric intensive care unit; practice guideline; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; prognostic assessment; protocol compliance; quality control; register; scoring system; survivor; systematic review,Article

Research efforts to better understand the biology of P. vivax hypnozoite and design relapse prevention strategies have been hampered by the lack of a robust and reliable model for in vitro culture of liver-stage parasites. Although the HC-04 hepatoma cell line is used for culturing liver-stage forms of Plasmodium, these cells proliferate unrestrictedly and detach from the culture dish after several days, which limits their usefulness in a long-term hypnozoite assay. Methods: A novel immortalized hepatocyte-like cell line (imHC) was evaluated for the capability to support P. vivax sporozoite infection. First, expression of basic hepatocyte markers and all major malaria sporozoite-associated host receptors in imHC was investigated. Next, in vitro hepatocyte infectivity and intracellular development of sporozoites in imHC were determined using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Cytochrome P450 isotype activity was also measured to determine the ability of imHC to metabolize drugs. Finally, the anti-liver-stage agent primaquine was used to test this model for a drug sensitivity assay. Results: imHCs maintained major hepatic functions and expressed the essential factors CD81, SR-BI and EphA2, which are required for host entry and development of the parasite in the liver. imHCs could be maintained long-term in a monolayer without overgrowth and thus served as a good, supportive substrate for the invasion and growth of P. vivax liver stages, including hypnozoites. The observed high drug metabolism activity and potent responses in liver-stage parasites to primaquine highlight the potential use of this imHC model for antimalarial drug screening. Conclusions: imHCs, which maintain a hepatocyte phenotype and drug-metabolizing enzyme expression, constitute an alternative host for in vitro Plasmodium liver-stage studies, particularly those addressing the biology of P. vivax hypnozoite. They potentially offer a novel, robust model for screening drugs against liver-stage parasites. © 2018 The Author(s).",imHCs; Liver stage; Malaria; Plasmodium vivax; Sporozoite,CD81 antigen; ephrin receptor A2; primaquine; scavenger receptor BI; Article; cell growth; drug metabolism; host parasite interaction; human; human cell; immortalized hepatocyte like cell line; in vitro study; liver; liver cell line; nonhuman; parasite development; Plasmodium vivax; protein expression; sporozoite,Article

The disease is highly contagious and considered to be a major obstacle causing significant economic loses in many agricultural areas. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to describe the transmission dynamics of capripoxvirus (CaPV) among livestock. This proposed model incorporates direct and indirect transmission of CaPV, together with two vaccination strategies, to investigate their effects on the severity of outbreaks and the prevalence of CaPV among the livestock population. The results suggest that ratio of potential vectors to livestock, successful probability of infection, vaccination rates, waning rate of vaccine-conferred protection, and virus introduction time play crucial roles in determining the outbreak severity and the prevalence level. The results also show that it is optimal to vaccinate newborns at the maximum effort throughout the control program and moderately increase vaccination rate for a susceptible pool to reach its maximum level after the outbreak. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Animal disease control; Epidemic model; Optimal control; Transmission dynamics,disease spread; disease transmission; disease vector; epidemic; infectivity; livestock farming; modeling; numerical model; vaccination; viral disease; Article; Capripoxvirus; controlled study; infection control; infection prevention; livestock; mathematical model; nonhuman; priority journal; seasonal variation; vaccination; virus transmission; Africa; Asia; Middle East; Animalia; Capripoxvirus,Article

Testing the virulence of MrNV alone has been problematic due to the difficulty in completely separating XSV from MrNV by viral purification steps from naturally infected shrimp. However, based on reports of natural M. rosenbergii specimens from WTD outbreak ponds that were positive for MrNV but negative for XSV led us to hypothesize that MrNV alone might cause WTD. To test this hypothesis, we prepared the two, complete genomic RNA fragments (RNA1 and RNA2) of MrNV from cDNA clones and used these to transfect Sf9 cells that subsequently showed cellular changes, including cell swelling, syncytial cell formation, and development of cytoplasmic inclusions within 72 h post-transfection. Replication of RNA1 and RNA2 increased in the transfected cells and transmission electron microscopy of the cell lysates revealed the presence of icosahedral viral-like particles that were 40–50 nm in diameter. When naïve Sf9 cells were inoculated with the cell lysate, the newly infected cells showed cellular changes and produced strong immunoreactivity against MrNV capsid protein indicating the infectious nature of the cell lysate. When the lysates were injected into the whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei, MrNV RNA replication in the shrimp was followed by morality accompanied by typical MrNV lesions that gave possible positive immunohistochemical reactions for the MrNV capsid protein. Treatment of the Sf9 cells with azidothymidine triphosphate (AZT) prior to transfection significantly increased viral RNA synthesis and pathogenicity when compared with untreated, transfected cells. Using this model to produce infectious MrNV without XSV contamination proves that MrNV alone can be lethal to shrimp and it opens the way to further investigate the molecular basis of MrNV pathogenesis, and to develop antiviral strategy to control white tail disease. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Azidothymidine triphosphate; Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus; Penaeus vannamei; Recovery; Sf9 cells,cells and cell components; clone; DNA; immunoassay; infectious disease; inhibitor; molecular analysis; pathogenicity; population outbreak; prawn culture; recovery; viral disease; virulence; virus; Decapoda (Crustacea); Litopenaeus vannamei; Macrobrachium rosenbergii; Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus; Miridae; White tip die-back phytoplasma,Article

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions/translocations are present in 13% to 17% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. BGJ398, an orally bioavailable, selective pan-FGFR kinase inhibitor, has shown preliminary clinical activity against tumors with FGFR alterations. Methods A multicenter, open-label, phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02150967) evaluated BGJ398 antitumor activity in patients age $ 18 years with advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma containing FGFR2 fusions or other FGFR alterations whose disease had progressed while receiving prior therapy. Patients received BGJ398 125 mg once daily for 21 days, then 7 days off (28-day cycles). The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response rate. Results Sixty-one patients (35 women; median age, 57 years) with FGFR2 fusion (n = 48), mutation (n = 8), or amplification (n = 3) participated. At the prespecified data cutoff (June 30, 2016), 50 patients had discontinued treatment. All responsive tumors contained FGFR2 fusions. The overall response rate was 14.8% (18.8% FGFR2 fusions only), disease control rate was 75.4% (83.3% FGFR2 fusions only), and estimated median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 7.6 months). Adverse events included hyperphosphatemia (72.1% all grade), fatigue (36.1%), stomatitis (29.5%), and alopecia (26.2%).

The results indicate that the sample ETFs domiciled in these economies perform poorly providing relatively low returns while exposing emerging market investors to substantial total and systematic risks. In addition, these ETFs are found to be more sensitive to downside risk, making them relatively more vulnerable to market downturns. Although the foreign-equity ETFs are designed to provide investors with full international diversification benefits, we find that they are significantly affected by their local market conditions and sentiments, making them ineffective international diversification tools. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",emerging market; ETFs; fund performance; international diversification,equity; exchange rate; foreign direct investment; market conditions; stock market,Article

Manual segmentation is a time-consuming process which is not practical for routine use. To address this limitation, several automated segmentation techniques for aortic aneurysm have been developed, such as edge detection-based methods, partial differential equation methods, and graph partitioning methods. However, automatic segmentation of aortic aneurysm is difficult due to high pixel similarity to adjacent tissue and a lack of color information in the medical image, preventing previous work from being applicable to difficult cases. This paper uses uses a variable neighborhood search that alternates between intensity-based and gradient-based segmentation techniques. By alternating between intensity and gradient spaces, the search can escape from local optima of each space. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other existing segmentation methods in the literature, based on measurements of dice similarity coefficient and jaccard similarity coefficient at the pixel level. In addition, it is shown to perform well for cases that are difficult to segment. © 2018 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine",Abdominal aortic aneurysm; Computed tomography; Graph cut; Iterative; Multi-layer segmentation; Probabilistic model; Variable neighborhood search,Blood vessels; Computerized tomography; Edge detection; Graphic methods; Iterative methods; Medical imaging; Optimization; Pixels; Abdominal aortic aneurysms; Graph cut; Iterative; Probabilistic modeling; Variable neighborhood search; Image segmentation,Article in Press

This study aims to explore the microRNA (miRNA) profile of CCA-associated fibroblasts (CCFs) and the roles of any identified miRNAs in CCA progression. Methods: miRNA expression profiles of CCFs and normal skin fibroblasts were compared by microarray. Identified downregulated miRNAs and their target genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. Their binding was confirmed by a luciferase reporter assay. The effects of conditioned-media (CM) of miRNA mimic- and antagonist-transfected CCFs were tested in CCA migration in wound healing assays. Finally, the levels of miRNA and their target genes were examined by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry in clinical CCA samples. Results: miR-15a was identified as a downregulated miRNA in CCFs. Moreover, PAI-2 was identified as a novel target gene of miR-15a. Recombinant PAI-2 promoted migration of CCA cells. Moreover, CM from miR-15a mimic-transfected CCFs suppressed migration of CCA cells. Lower expression of miR-15a and higher expression of PAI-2 were observed in human CCA samples compared with normal liver tissues. Importantly, PAI-2 expression correlated with poor prognosis in CCA patients. Conclusions: These findings highlight the miR-15a/PAI-2 axis as a potential therapeutic target in CCA patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",Cancer-associated fibroblasts; Cholangiocarcinoma; MicroRNA (miRNA); Migration; PAI-2; Tumor microenvironment,microRNA 15a; plasminogen activator inhibitor 2; adult; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cancer associated fibroblast; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; cell migration; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; informed consent; luciferase assay; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; protein expression; protein RNA binding; real time polymerase chain reaction; skin fibroblast; wound healing assay,Article

We sought to develop an age-based SLDPQ regimen that would be suitable for sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Using data on the anti-infectivity efficacy and tolerability of primaquine (PQ), the epidemiology of anaemia, and the risks of PQ-induced acute haemolytic anaemia (AHA) and clinically significant anaemia (CSA), we prospectively defined therapeutic-dose ranges of 0.15-0.4 mg PQ base/kg for children aged 1-5 years and 0.15-0.5 mg PQ base/kg for individuals aged ≥6 years (therapeutic indices 2.7 and 3.3, respectively). We chose 1.25 mg PQ base for infants aged 6-11 months because they have the highest rate of baseline anaemia and the highest risks of AHA and CSA. We modelled an anthropometric database of 661,979 African individuals aged ≥6 months (549,127 healthy individuals, 28,466 malaria patients and 84,386 individuals with other infections/illnesses) by the Box-Cox transformation power exponential and tested PQ doses of 1-15 mg base, selecting dosing groups based on calculated mg/kg PQ doses. Results: From the Box-Cox transformation power exponential model, five age categories were selected: (i) 6-11 months (n = 39,886, 6.03%), (ii) 1-5 years (n = 261,036, 45.46%), (iii) 6-9 years (n = 20,770, 3.14%), (iv) 10-14 years (n = 12,155, 1.84%) and (v) ≥15 years (n = 328,132, 49.57%) to receive 1.25, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 15 mg PQ base for corresponding median (1st and 99th centiles) mg/kg PQ base of: (i) 0.16 (0.12-0.25), (ii) 0.21 (0.13-0.37), (iii) 0.25 (0.16-0.38), (iv) 0.26 (0.15-0.38) and (v) 0.27 (0.17-0.40). The proportions of individuals predicted to receive optimal therapeutic PQ doses were: 73.2 (29,180/39,886), 93.7 (244,537/261,036), 99.6 (20,690/20,770), 99.4 (12,086/12,155) and 99.8% (327,620/328,132), respectively. Conclusions: We plan to test the safety of this age-based dosing regimen in a large randomised placebo-controlled trial (ISRCTN11594437) of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in G6PDd African children aged 0.5 - 11 years. If the regimen is safe and demonstrates adequate pharmacokinetics, it should be used to support malaria elimination. © 2018 The Author(s).",Age-based dosing; Malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; Primaquine; Transmission blocking,"primaquine; antimalarial agent; primaquine; abdominal pain; acute disease; acute hemolytic anemia; acute hemolytic anemia; adolescent; adult; Africa south of the Sahara; African; age; anemia; anthropometric parameters; Article; biological model; child; clinically significant anemia; controlled study; dose calculation; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; female; hemolytic anemia; high risk patient; human; infant; low drug dose; major clinical study; malaria falciparum; male; methemoglobinemia; parasite transmission; preschool child; prospective study; school child; single drug dose; age; aged; clinical protocol; dose response; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; malaria falciparum; middle aged; Plasmodium falciparum; transmission; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Africa South of the Sahara; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antimalarials; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Protocols; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Humans; Infant; Malaria, Falciparum; Male; Middle Aged; Plasmodium falciparum; Primaquine; Young Adult",Article

Study design: We performed a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study of deliveries occurring at <34 weeks at a tertiary care center in 2013–2014. About 139 women who underwent early cord clamping were compared with 130 women delivered after DCC protocol implementation. Maternal estimated blood loss (EBL) was the primary outcome of interest. Operative times, post-Cesarean decrease in hemoglobin (Hgb), and rates of post-partum hemorrhage and transfusion were also examined in bivariate and multivariable analyses. Results: About 75% of post-guideline deliveries had actual DCC. In regression analyses, only Cesarean delivery and multifetal gestation increased EBL. No trends were identified in EBL over time. In post-hoc analysis, the study had over 80% power to detect a difference in post-partum hemorrhage rates of 20%.

Activated cardiac fibroblasts have the ability to increase collagen synthesis, cell proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation, leading to cardiac fibrosis. However, it is unknown which β-AR subtypes and signaling pathways mediate the upregulation of paracrine factors in cardiac myocytes. In this study, we demonstrated that sustained stimulation of β-ARs significantly induced synthesis and secretion of growth factors, including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), via the cAMP-dependent and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathways. In addition, isoproterenol (ISO)-mediated synthesis and secretion of CTGF and VEGF through the β1-AR and β2-AR subtypes. Paracrine factors released by cardiac myocytes following sustained β-AR stimulation are necessary for the induction of cell proliferation and synthesis of collagen I, collagen III and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in cardiac fibroblasts, confirming that β-AR overstimulation of cardiac myocytes induces cardiac fibrosis by releasing several paracrine factors. These effects can be antagonized by β-blockers, including atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol. Thus, the use of β-blockers may have beneficial effects on the treatment of myocardial fibrosis in patients with heart failure. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",cAMP; Cardiac fibroblast; Cardiac myocyte; Paracrine factor; PKA; β-Adrenergic receptor,"alpha smooth muscle actin; beta 1 adrenergic receptor; beta 2 adrenergic receptor; beta adrenergic receptor; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; collagen type 1; collagen type 3; connective tissue growth factor; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; growth factor; isoprenaline; metoprolol; propranolol; vasculotropin; beta 2 adrenergic receptor; beta adrenergic receptor; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cytokine; isoprenaline; signal peptide; vasculotropin A; activation analysis; adrenergic receptor blocking; animal cell; Article; beta adrenergic stimulation; cAMP signaling; cardiac muscle cell; cardiovascular autoregulation; cell activation; cell proliferation; collagen synthesis; controlled study; gene expression regulation; heart fibroblast; heart muscle fibrosis; newborn; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; protein secretion; protein synthesis; rat; receptor upregulation; treatment outcome; animal; cardiac muscle; cardiac muscle cell; cell differentiation; drug effects; fibroblast; heart; metabolism; physiology; primary cell culture; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Cytokines; Fibroblasts; Heart; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Isoproterenol; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Primary Cell Culture; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",Article

However, at the same time, artemisinin resistance has spread, raising concerns about the efficacy of parenteral artesunate for the treatment of severe malaria. Case presentation: In November 2015 and April 2017, two patients were treated for severe malaria with parenteral artesunate. Quinine was added within 24 h due to an initial poor response to treatment. The first patient died within 24 h of starting treatment and the second did not clear his peripheral parasitaemia until 11 days later. Genotyping revealed artemisinin resistance Kelch-13 markers. Conclusions: Reliable efficacy of artesunate for the treatment of severe malaria may no longer be assured in areas where artemisinin resistance has emerged. Empirical addition of parenteral quinine to artesunate for treatment is recommended as a precautionary measure. © 2018 The Author(s).",Artemisinin resistance; Artesunate; Kelch 13; Quinine; Severe malaria,artemether plus benflumetol; artemisinin; artesunate; atovaquone plus proguanil; bicarbonate; CD4 antigen; creatinine; glucose; potassium; quinine; sodium; urea; adult; agricultural worker; antimalarial drug resistance; Article; case report; CD4 lymphocyte count; cerebral malaria; clinical article; death; disease severity; genotype; glucose blood level; hematocrit; hospital discharge; human; malaria falciparum; male; Myanmar; neutrophil; parasitemia; patient referral; Plasmodium falciparum; Thailand; treatment response; urea nitrogen blood level,Article

A flow system comprising two sets of MBL-VP units with a single in-house capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector (C4D) was developed for dual determination of ammonium and sulfide ions. Using the continuous-flow section, two zones (280 μL) of a sample, either mixed with sodium hydroxide (for ammonium) or hydrochloric acid (for sulfide), are separately delivered into the donor reservoir of the MBL-VP units. The acceptor reservoir contains either 150 μL of 15 μM HCl solution (for ammonia) or pure water (for hydrogen sulfide), respectively. Vaporization and trapping of the ammonia or hydrogen sulfide gas from the donor reservoir into the liquid acceptor cone occur concurrently in the two separate MBL-VP units. After trapping the gas for 3 min, the two 150-μL liquid acceptors are sequentially aspirated through the C4D flow cell for recording the changes in the conductivity. Linear calibrations were obtained for ammonium from 5 to 80 µM (Volt = (0.0134 ± 0.0003) [NH4 +] – (0.01 ± 0.01), r2 = 0.998) and for sulfide from 5 to 200 µM (Volt = (0.0335 ± 0.0009) [S2-] – (0.13 ± 0.09), r2 = 0.996). Analysis time for both analytes is only 320 s. Our method was applied to analyze canal water samples.

We compared the outcomes of patients receiving short-course (6-10 days) vs prolonged-course (11-16 days) antibiotic therapy for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at 3 medical centers and included patients with monomicrobial Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia treated with in vitro active therapy in the range of 6-16 days between 2008 and 2014. 1:1 nearest neighbor propensity score matching without replacement was performed prior to regression analysis to estimate the risk of all-cause mortality within 30 days after the end of antibiotic treatment comparing patients in the 2 treatment groups. Secondary outcomes included recurrent bloodstream infections, Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), and the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDRGN) bacteria, all within 30 days after the end of antibiotic therapy. Results There were 385 well-balanced matched pairs. The median duration of therapy in the short-course group and prolonged-course group was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-9 days) and 15 days (IQR, 13-15 days), respectively. No difference in mortality between the treatment groups was observed (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI],.62-1.63). The odds of recurrent bloodstream infections and CDI were also similar. There was a trend toward a protective effect of short-course antibiotic therapy on the emergence of MDRGN bacteria (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI,.32-1.09; P =.09). Conclusions Short courses of antibiotic therapy yield similar clinical outcomes as prolonged courses of antibiotic therapy for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia, and may protect against subsequent MDRGN bacteria. © The Author(s) 2017.

Recently, short-term treatment with Rh-α4β7 in combination with cART was found to lead to prolonged viral suppression after withdrawal of all therapeutic interventions. The humanized form of Rh-α4β7, vedolizumab, is a highly effective treatment for inflammatory bowel disease. To clarify the mechanism of action of Rh-α4β7, naive macaques were infused with Rh-α4β7 and sampled in blood and tissues before and after treatment to monitor several immune cell subsets. In blood, Rh-α4β7 increased the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, but not B cell counts, and preferentially increased CCR6+ subsets while decreasing CD103+ and CD69+ lymphocytes. In mucosal tissues, surprisingly, Rh-α4β7 did not impact integrin α4 + cells, but decreased the frequencies of CCR6+ and CD69+ CD4+ T cells and, in the gut, Rh-α4β7 transiently decreased the frequency of memory and IgA+ B cells. In summary, even in the absence of inflammation, Rh-α4β7 impacted selected immune cell subsets in different tissues. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms by which Rh-α4β7 may mediate its effect in SIV-infected macaques with implications for understanding the effect of treatment with vedolizumab in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

While studies related to the genetic diversity of these proteins are available for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, barely enough information exists regarding Plasmodium malariae. The present study aims to demonstrate the genetic variations existing among these three genes in P. malariae by analysing their diversity at nucleotide and protein levels. Methods: Three surface protein genes were isolated from 45 samples collected in Thailand (N = 33), Myanmar (N = 8), and Lao PDR (N = 4), using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Then, the PCR products were sequenced and analysed using BioEdit, MEGA6, and DnaSP programs. Results: The average pairwise nucleotide diversities (π) of P. malariae trap, ama1, and p48/45 were 0.00169, 0.00413, and 0.00029, respectively. The haplotype diversities (Hd) of P. malariae trap, ama1, and p48/45 were 0.919, 0.946, and 0.130, respectively. Most of the nucleotide substitutions were non-synonymous, which indicated that the genetic variations of these genes were maintained by positive diversifying selection, thus, suggesting their role as a potential target of protective immune response. Amino acid substitutions of P. malariae TRAP, AMA1, and P48/45 could be categorized to 17, 20, and 2 unique amino-acid variants, respectively. For further vaccine development, carboxyl terminal of P48/45 would be a good candidate according to conserved amino acid at low genetic diversity (π = 0.2-0.3). Conclusions: High mutational diversity was observed in P. malariae trap and ama1 as compared to p48/45 in P. malariae samples isolated from Thailand, Myanmar, and Lao PDR. Taken together, these results suggest that P48/45 might be a good vaccine candidate against P. malariae infection because of its sufficiently low genetic diversity and highly conserved amino acids especially on the carboxyl end. © 2018 The Author(s).",AMA1; P48/45; Plasmodium malariae; TRAP,apical membrane antigen 1; membrane protein; six cysteine rich protein; thrombospondin related anonymous protein; unclassified drug; amino acid substitution; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; diversifying selection; genetic conservation; genetic variability; haplotype; immune response; Laos; Myanmar; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Plasmodium malariae; polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; Thailand,Article

It is also associated with the development of diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, the rapid identification of MS is required to prevent the occurrence of such diseases. Herein, we review the utilization of data mining approaches for MS identification. Furthermore, the concept of quantitative population-health relationship (QPHR) is also presented, which can be defined as the elucida-tion/understanding of the relationship that exists between health parameters and health status. The QPHR modeling uses data mining techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and association analysis (AA) for modeling and construction of predictive models for MS characterization. The DT method has been found to outperform other data mining techniques in the identification of MS status. Moreover, the AA technique has proved useful in the discovery of in-depth as well as frequently occurring health parameters that can be used for revealing the rules of MS development. This review presents the potential benefits on the applications of data mining as a rapid identification tool for classifying MS. © 2018, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors.

Materials and Methods: Children ages 6-8 years were recruited. Forty-nine primary molars with deep carious lesions were studied. The carious dentin was removed at the dentoenamel junction (DEJ) and restored with GIC. Digital radiographs were taken immediately after restoration, and at 6 and 12 months after restoration. The sets of digital radiographs were subtracted and analysed using Image-Pro Plus software. Results: At the 12-month follow-up, 38 of the original 49 primary molars were analysed. No postoperative pain or signs of pulp pathology were reported. 76% and 87% of molars showed an increase in density of the studied areas compared to control areas at 6- and 12- month follow-ups, respectively. The density of digital subtraction radiographs increased to 5.3 and 8.2 at 6 and 12 months from baseline, respectively. The mean density of the areas under restoration at 6 months and 12 months was statistically significantly higher than at baseline (paired t-test; p < 0.05). Conclusion: Using digital subtraction radiographs, GIC restorations with partial carious dentin removal in primary molars showed a high potential for dentin remineralisation after 1 year. © Quintessenz.",Digital subtraction radiography; Partial removal of carious dentin; Primary teeth,"glass ionomer; child; deciduous tooth; dental caries; dental procedure; dental restoration; dentin; diagnostic imaging; female; human; image subtraction; male; molar tooth; tooth radiography; Child; Dental Caries; Dental Restoration, Permanent; Dentin; Female; Glass Ionomer Cements; Humans; Male; Molar; Radiography, Dental; Subtraction Technique; Tooth Remineralization; Tooth, Deciduous",Article

The immunogenicity of the M2 domain of the Merozoite Adhesive Erythrocytic Binding Protein (MAEBL) antigen cloned from the Plasmodium yoelii murine parasite, has been previously demonstrated. Results: Detailed epitope mapping of MAEBL through immunoinformatics identified several MHCI, MHCII and B cell epitopes throughout the peptide, with several of these lying in the M2 domain and being conserved between P. vivax, P. yoelii and Plasmodium falciparum, hinting that the M2-MAEBL is pan-reactive. This hypothesis was tested through functional assays, showing that P. yoelii M2-MAEBL antisera are able to recognize and inhibit erythrocyte invasion from both P. falciparum and P. vivax parasites isolated from Thai patients, in ex vivo assays. Moreover, the sequence of the M2-MAEBL is shown to be highly conserved between P. vivax isolates from the Amazon and Thailand, indicating that the MAEBL antigen may constitute a vaccine candidate outwitting strain-specific immunity. Conclusions: The MAEBL antigen is promising candidate towards the development of a malaria vaccine. © 2018 The Author(s).",,epitope; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; malaria vaccine; merozoite adhesive erythrocytic binding protein antigen; unclassified drug; Amazonas (Brazil); amino acid sequence; animal experiment; animal model; Article; B lymphocyte; cell invasion; clinical article; computer model; controlled study; dose response; drug dose comparison; epitope mapping; erythrocyte; ex vivo study; human; immunogenicity; malaria falciparum; molecular cloning; mouse; nonhuman; parasite isolation; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; Plasmodium yoelii; protein domain; sequence alignment; Thailand,Article

A high proportion of the target population participated in the MDA, with over 87% agreeing to take the anti-malarial. Drawing on qualitative data collected alongside the MDA, this article explores the factors that led to this high population coverage. Methods: Qualitative data collection methods included observations, which were recorded in field notes, focus group discussions (FGDs), and semi-structured interviews (SSIs). Data were collected on local context, MDA-related knowledge, attitudes and perceptions. FGDs and SSIs were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated to English. All transcriptions and field notes underwent qualitative content analysis using QSR NVivo. Results: Respondents recognized malaria as a health concern and described the need for a malaria control program. The risk of malaria including asymptomatic infection was explained in terms of participants' work in forest and fields, and poor hygiene. During the MDA rounds, there was an improvement in knowledge on the concept of asymptomatic malaria, the rationale of MDA and the blood test. In all four villages, poverty affected access to healthcare and the provision of free care by TME was highly appreciated. TME was jointly undertaken by research staff and local volunteers. Authorities were involved in all TME activities. Lao Theung communities were cohesive and community members tended to follow each other's behaviour closely including participation in MDA. Factors such as understanding the concept and rationale of the study, free health care, collaboration with the village volunteers, support from authorities and cohesive communities contributed in building trust and high population coverage in MDA. Conclusion: Future malaria control programmes can become successful in achieving the high coverage in MDAs drawing from the success of TME in Laos. A high population coverage in TME was a combination of various factors that included the community engagement to promote the concept and rationale of MDA for asymptomatic malaria in addition to their baseline understanding of malaria as a health concern, provision of free primary health care, partnering of the research with local volunteers and authorities, building social relationship with community members and the cohesive nature of the communities boosted the trust and participation in MDA. © 2018 The Author(s).",Coverage; Factors; Laos; Malaria; Mass drug administration; Partnership; Qualitative; Trust; Volunteers,antimalarial agent; adult; aged; Article; attitude; blood examination; community participation; controlled study; data collection method; decreased appetite; educational status; epigastric pain; fatigue; female; headache; health care access; human; infection risk; knowledge; Laos; malaise; malaria; malaria control; male; occupation; perception; personal hygiene; poverty; qualitative research; social participation; somnolence,Article

Methods: Adult patients directly admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care units of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka between 21st July 2014 and 1st October 2014 with moderate or severe TBI were recruited. A telephone administered questionnaire based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) was used to assess functional outcome of patients at 3 and 6months after injury. The economic impact of the injury was assessed before injury, and at 3 and 6months after injury. Results: One hundred and one patients were included in the study. Survival at ICU discharge, 3 and 6months after injury was 68.3%, 49.5% and 45.5% respectively. Of the survivors at 3months after injury, 43 (86%) were living at home.Only 19(38%)patients had a good recovery (as defined by GOSE 7 and 8). Three months and six months after injury, respectively 25 (50%) and 14 (30.4%) patients had become ""economically dependent"". Selected trauma scores had poor discriminatoryability in predicting mortality. Conclusions: This observational study of patients sustaining moderate or severe TBI in Sri Lanka (a LMIC) reveals only 46% of patients were alive at 6months after ICU discharge and only 20% overall attained a good (GOSE 7 or 8) recovery. The social and economic consequences of TBI were long lasting in this setting.

Comparative 16 S rRNA analysis revealed that cave soil was highly dominated by Actinobacteria; whereas, Proteobacteria was highly abundant outside the cave. As Actinobacteria are biotechnologically valuable for their secondary metabolites, the diversity of the β-ketoacyl synthase (KSβ) was investigated. The results showed that the identified KSβ has 61–80% amino acid sequence identity to known sequences. Phylogenetic analysis placed some of the sequences in novel clades, suggesting the presence of novel KSβ domains.

There have been significant advancements in the development of in vitro and in vivo experiments that generate data used to inform decisions about the potential merit of new compounds. A comprehensive disease-drug model capable of integrating discrete data from different preclinical and clinical components would be a valuable tool across all stages of drug development.

Treatment of motor and phonic tics is difficult and challenging. Objectives: To determine the safety and effectiveness of botulinum toxin in treating motor and phonic tics in people with Tourette's syndrome, and to analyse the effect of botulinum toxin on premonitory urge and sensory tics. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and two trials registers to 25 October 2017. We reviewed reference lists of relevant articles for additional trials. Selection criteria: We considered all randomised, controlled, double-blind studies comparing botulinum toxin to placebo or other medications for the treatment of motor and phonic tics in Tourette's syndrome for this review. We sought both parallel group and cross-over studies of children or adults, at any dose, and for any duration. Data collection and analysis: We followed standard Cochrane methods to select studies, assess risk of bias, extract and analyse data. All authors independently abstracted data onto standardized forms; disagreements were resolved by mutual discussion. Main results: Only one randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study met our selection criteria. In this study, 20 participants with motor tics were enrolled over a three-year recruitment period; 18 (14 of whom had a diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome) completed the study; in total, 21 focal motor tics were treated. Although we considered most bias domains to be at low risk of bias, the study recruited a small number of participants with relatively mild tics and provided limited data for our key outcomes. The effects of botulinum toxin injections on tic frequency, measured by videotape or rated subjectively, and on premonitory urge, are uncertain (very low-quality evidence). The quality of evidence for adverse events following botulinum toxin was very low. Nine people had muscle weakness following the injection, which could have led to unblinding of treatment group assignment. No data were available to evaluate whether botulinum injections led to immunoresistance to botulinum. Authors' conclusions: We are uncertain about botulinum toxin effects in the treatment of focal motor and phonic tics in select cases, as we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. Additional randomised controlled studies are needed to demonstrate the benefits and harms of botulinum toxin therapy for the treatment of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette's syndrome. © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Moreover, higher volume of passive rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) due to weight based dosing might suppress vaccine-induced immune responses in obese patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of obesity on humoral immune responses to combined equine RIG and rabies vaccine treatment among patients with WHO category III exposure to a rabies suspected animal. Methods A single centre, prospective, open-labelled study among WHO category III rabies exposed patients was conducted to compare serum rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) responses measured by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test between obese (body mass index, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) and control (BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2) patients after combined immunization with equine rabies immunoglobulin and purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine for post exposure prophylaxis treatment. Results Post-vaccination geometric mean titer (GMT) of RVNA concentrations between two groups at day 7 were 0.33 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.46) vs 0.39 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.55), 4.61 (95% CI: 3.20, 6.63) vs 3.78 (95% CI: 2.77, 5.16) at day 14, and 7.45 (95% CI: 5.86, 9.49) vs 5.93 (95%CI: 4.46–7.90) at day 28 for obese and control patients, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference of RVNA GMT between two groups. Seroconversion to at least adequate concentration (RVNA titer ≥0.5 IU/mL) rates were 34% at day 7 and 100% at days 14 and 28 in both groups. There were no immediate hypersensitivity reaction and no serious adverse events observed during the study period. Conclusions There was no evidence of immunosuppression of antibodies’ responses in obese patients.

These studies were aimed to generate comprehensive study on EHP infection as well as establishing innovative strategies to reduce its viability and potential infectivity in shrimp farms. The EHP spore purification method by using Percoll gradient separation with ultracentrifugation step at 15 °C has been developed. The viability of the purified spores has been evaluated by its polar tube extrusion with Phloxin B staining. The active EHP spores were exposed to different temperature (−20 °C, 4 °C and 33 °C) and chemical treatments including calcium hypochlorite, formalin, potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and ethanol to identify the conditions that can be used to inhibit the extrusion of the polar tube. Complete inhibition of activity was demonstrated either by freezing the spores at −20 °C for at least 2 h or by treating them with chemicals. The chemicals that yielded 100% inhibition were 15 ppm KMnO4 for 15 min, 40 ppm of 65% active chlorine for 15 min or 10 ppm of 65% active chlorine for 24 h and 20% ethanol for 15 min. However 200 ppm formalin resulted in a maximum reduction of 95.33%. Taken together, our protocol demonstrates for the first time that living EHP spores can be isolated and purified, providing a potential platform for future testing and development of EHP's control strategies. © 2018",Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei; Growth retardation; Spore inactivation; Spore purification,Decapoda (Crustacea); Enterocytozoon; Penaeidae,Article

Diagnosis of diseases of the hepatopancreas usually required an isolation of the organ and the process cannot avoid sacrificing the shrimp. To save life of the animal, this study was aimed at taking hepatopancreatic tissue from the shrimp by biopsy process. Thirty-two sexually mature adults of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon were used as the shrimp model and small pieces of their hepatopancreatic tissue were taken by needle biopsy. Specific position of the needle penetration was suggested to avoid damage to the heart and the gills. From the lateral view of the carapace of the shrimp, this position was at one-third from the rostral end of a line drawn from the last dorsal spine of the rostrum to the posterior margin of the carapace. From the top view, this point was located at a medial quarter of a line drawn from the midline of the carapace toward the lateral extremity. The needle was inserted vertically at a depth of 1 cm into the hepatopancreas, and small pieces of the tissue were quickly withdrawn into the syringe. After the operation, the shrimp were released into rearing tanks and observed for any mortality or morbidity for two months, during which all the shrimp survived and remained apparently healthy. The hepatopancreatic tissues taken from the biopsy were processed for polymerase chain (PCR) reaction method, fresh smear and histology. The PCR revealed the presence of Penaeus monodon densovirus (PmoDNV) in 40% of the samples. The fresh smear and histology revealed good quality of cell morphology and histological features, as well as PmoDNV inclusions in the PCR-positive samples. This study suggests that needle biopsy of hepatopancreas to detect pathogens, or to evaluate health status, of this organ in shrimp is possible, at least in P. monodon. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Broodstock; Diagnosis; Hatchery; Midgut gland; PmoDNV,bioassay; brood stock; crustacean; detection method; digestive system; disease incidence; histology; morbidity; morphology; mortality; polymerase chain reaction; viral disease; virus; Animalia; Decapoda (Crustacea); Densovirus; Penaeus monodon,Article

We tested three hypotheses: (1) Buddhist values (e.g., gratitude, generosity and altruism) arise by how frequently people engage in institutionalized Buddhist practices (e.g., praying, meditation, offering food to the monks); (2) The observation of institutionalized Buddhist practices is linked to higher levels of happiness, improved family and community connections and lower levels of negative emotions, depending on to the extent to which individuals incorporate Buddhist values into their behavior; and (3) The path from Buddhism (practices and values) to self-perceived health is mediated by happiness, negative emotions, and family and community connections. The model had a very good fit with the data, corroborating all hypotheses. The strongest indirect path from Buddhist practices to health was mediated by happiness. The results indicate that religion benefits self-perceived health mediated by how much an individual engages in religious practices and the extent to which those practices nurture human virtues.

Interestingly, a therapy including the combination of the iron chelator deferiprone (DFP) plus the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to significantly decrease oxidative stress and restore heart and brain function in iron-overloaded rats. However, the cardioprotective effects of this combined DFP and NAC treatment in thalassemic mice have not been investigated. We hypothesised that the combination of DFP and NAC exerts better cardioprotection than monotherapy via decreasing cardiac iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in thalassemic mice. The iron-overload condition was induced in heterozygous βKO HT and wild-type mice by instigating high iron diet consumption (FE) for three months. Then, iron chelator DFP (75 mg/kg/day twice a day), antioxidant NAC (100 mg/kg/day once a day), and combined DFP plus NAC were fed via oral gavage for one month with continuous iron feeding. Left ventricular (LV) function, heart rate variability (HRV), apoptosis, and cardiac iron accumulation were determined. Chronic iron-overload in mice led to increased cardiac iron deposition, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and impaired LV function and HRV. Although DFP and NAC showed similar cardioprotective efficacy, combined DFP plus NAC exerted greater efficacy in reducing both cardiac iron deposition and cellular apoptosis than monotherapy. In conclusion, combined iron chelator and NAC treatment exert the greatest cardioprotective efficacy when compared with either of the monotherapies in iron-overload thalassemic mice. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",antioxidant; apoptosis; iron-overload cardiomyopathy; oxidative stress; Thalassemia,acetylcysteine; deferiprone; iron; malonaldehyde; adult; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; chronic disease; controlled study; dietary intake; drug effect; drug potentiation; heart left ventricle function; heart protection; heart rate variability; iron intake; iron overload; male; monotherapy; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; thalassemia,Article

We evaluate whether the status of being overweight or obese is associated with increase in the development of hepatotoxicity and acute liver injury (ALI) in patients with acute acetaminophen overdose. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing the risk of hepatotoxicity and ALI between overweight or obese patients (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25) and normal BMI patients (BMI ≤ 24.9) presenting with acute acetaminophen overdose at Siriraj Hospital during January 2004 to June 2012. All patients were treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine. Psi parameters were calculated. High psi was defined as psi of ≥5.0 mM-hour. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regressions, odds ratio (OR), stratified OR, and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: There were 197 patients who fulfilled the criteria for analysis, 35 (17.8%) were obese, 24 (12.2%) were overweight, and 138 (70%) were normal BMI cases. Hepatotoxicity and ALI developed in 25 (12.7%) and 40 (20.3%) cases, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that the overweight-obesity status and log10(psi value) were significant risk factors of ALI, with OR (95% CI) of 2.68 (1.21-5.95) and 1.74 (1.27-2.38), respectively, while only log10(psi) was a significant risk factor of hepatotoxicity with OR (95% CI) 378.51 (39.49-3627.99). From stratification, overweight-obesity had significant odds ratios for ALI in strata with low acetaminophen concentration, early initiation of N-acetylcysteine and low psi. Conclusion: We conclude that being overweight or obese is an independent risk factor of ALI in acute acetaminophen overdoses.

In this paper we compare Bayesian network models built for the outbreak classification problem with Bayesian network, ARIMA and ARIMAX models built for numeric prediction and used for outbreak prediction by thresholding. We show that in most cases the classification models outperform the other models. We then investigate the reasons underlying the differences in performance among the models in order to shed light on their strengths and weaknesses.

In this study, the enzyme matching approach was proposed to optimize liquefaction and saccharification yield of cassava root and cassava starch. For fresh cassava root, the synergistic effect of using Techzyme Q-Add enzyme (93 °C pH 5.6) for liquefaction and GC 147 enzyme (61.5 °C pH 4.2) for saccharification achieved the highest yield among all enzyme-matching designs. At 25% solid, highest total reducing sugar (TRS) yields from sequential liquefaction and saccharification of cassava starch, fresh cassava, and dry cassava were 87.9%, 85.1%, and 70.0% corresponding to 286.8, 249.4, and 241.1 g/L, respectively. For VHG ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR 5606, separate liquefaction and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SLSSF) gave a significantly higher ethanol concentration compared with separate liquefaction and saccharification and fermentation (SLSF). From a 35% solid SLSSF system, the highest ethanol produced at 30 °C was 27.3 g/L from 72 h, respectively. The results suggested that SLSSF could effectively shorten the time course of the whole process for liquefaction, saccharification, and fermentation from 74 h to only 26 h for similar ethanol production yields. © 2018 North Carolina State University.",Cassava root and cassava starch; Enzyme matching design approach; Ethanol fermentation; High gravity; Saccharification and fermentation; Separate and simultaneous liquefaction,Enzymes; Ethanol; Fermentation; Liquefaction; Separation; Starch; Yeast; Cassava starch; Design approaches; Ethanol concentrations; Ethanol fermentation; High gravity; Hydrolyzing enzymes; Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation; Total reducing sugars; Saccharification,Article

However, the mechanism of extracellular dsRNA uptake into shrimp cells has not been determined. Systemic RNA interference defective-1 protein (SID-1) is a transmembrane protein which is required for dsRNA transport between cells in several organisms including Caenorhabditis elegans but not in Drosophila and some insects. Recently, a SID-1 homolog (LvSID-1) was identified in whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether LvSID-1 is involved in the uptake of dsRNA into shrimp cells. LvSID-1 mRNA expression was up-regulated in gills and muscles but not in hepatopancreas of the shrimp that received long dsRNA introduced by injection. To elucidate the role of LvSID-1 in dsRNA uptake, a strategy of sequential introduction of dsRNAs was employed. Shrimp were initially injected with a long dsRNA to induce LvSID-1 mRNA expression. In a first experiment hemocytes of the LvSID-1 induced shrimp were then collected and seeded in a chamber slide before incubation with Cy3-labeled dsRNA to monitor cellular uptake. Under a confocal microscope, the Cy3 signal in the LvSID-1 induced hemocytes was significantly higher than the signal in naïve hemocytes. In a second experiment, LvSID-1 induced shrimp were separately injected with a second dsRNAs specific to a shrimp endogenous gene (signal transduction and transcription protein (STAT) or clathrin heavy chain (CHC)). Levels of STAT or CHC suppression in the LvSID-1 induced-shrimp compared with the control shrimp reflected the efficiency of uptake of the second dsRNA. Significantly, improved suppression of STAT and CHC was found in gills of the LvSID-1 induced shrimp. These results suggest that LvSID-1 participates in the uptake of injected dsRNA into shrimp cells. This study reports for the first time the involvement of the LvSID-1 in dsRNA uptake in shrimp, which could help to improve the potency of RNAi mediated anti-viral approaches in shrimp in the future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",dsRNA uptake; Litopenaeus vannamei; RNAi; SID-1,cells and cell components; crustacean; fly; gene; gene expression; genomics; protein; RNA; Caenorhabditis elegans; Decapoda (Crustacea); Hexapoda; Litopenaeus vannamei,Article

While a diversity of modeling technique have been used to create predictive models of malaria, no work has made use of Bayesian networks. Bayes nets are attractive due to their ability to represent uncertainty, model time lagged and nonlinear relations, and provide explanations. This paper explores the use of Bayesian networks to model malaria, demonstrating the approach by creating village level models with weekly temporal resolution for Tha Song Yang district in northern Thailand. The networks are learned using data on cases and environmental covariates. Three types of networks are explored: networks for numeric prediction, networks for outbreak prediction, and networks that incorporate spatial autocorrelation. Evaluation of the numeric prediction network shows that the Bayes net has prediction accuracy in terms of mean absolute error of about 1.4 cases for 1 week prediction and 1.7 cases for 6 week prediction. The network for outbreak prediction has an ROC AUC above 0.9 for all prediction horizons. Comparison of prediction accuracy of both Bayes nets against several traditional modeling approaches shows the Bayes nets to outperform the other models for longer time horizon prediction of high incidence transmission. To model spread of malaria over space, we elaborate the models with links between the village networks. This results in some very large models which would be far too laborious to build by hand. So we represent the models as collections of probability logic rules and automatically generate the networks. Evaluation of the models shows that the autocorrelation links significantly improve prediction accuracy for some villages in regions of high incidence. We conclude that spatiotemporal Bayesian networks are a highly promising modeling alternative for prediction of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian networks; Malaria prediction; Probability logic; Spatiotemporal models,Autocorrelation; Computer circuits; Decision making; Diseases; Forecasting; Knowledge based systems; Malaria control; Probabilistic logics; Rural areas; Mean absolute error; Nonlinear relations; Prediction accuracy; Probability logic; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatio-temporal models; Temporal resolution; Vector-borne disease; Bayesian networks; accuracy; Article; Bayesian learning; decision making; epidemic; geography; human; malaria; malaria control; prediction; priority journal; resource allocation; Thailand,Article

Methanol extract showed less variety of lipid components compared to the others. However, hexane extract showed the highest percent of γ-oryzanol compared to other solvents. Therefore, the hexane extract was selected to prepare nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). The prepared NLC had small particles in the size range of 142.9 ± 0.4 nm for extract-loaded NLC and 137.1 ± 0.5 nm for GO-loaded NLC with narrow size distribution (PI < 0.1) in both formulations. The release profile of extract-loaded NLC formulation was slightly higher than GO-loaded NLC formulation. However, they did not follow the Higuchi model because of small amounts of γ-oryzanol loaded in NLC particles. © 2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.",Glutinous rice bran; Leum Pua; Nanostructured lipid carriers; Solvent extraction; γ-oryzanol,Antioxidants; Data mining; Fatty acids; Hexane; Linoleic acid; Palmitic acid; Solvents; Different solvents; Glutinous rice; Leum Pua; Nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC); Nanostructured lipid carriers; Narrow size distributions; Oryzanol; Release profiles; Solvent extraction; antioxidant; drug carrier; gamma-oryzanol; hexane; linoleic acid; nanomaterial; oleic acid; palmitic acid; phenylpropionic acid derivative; plant extract; solvent; chemistry; isolation and purification; Oryza; particle size; Antioxidants; Drug Carriers; Hexanes; Linoleic Acid; Nanostructures; Oleic Acid; Oryza; Palmitic Acid; Particle Size; Phenylpropionates; Plant Extracts; Solvents,Article

In this study, in order to further explore this topic, we present an alternative approach to Khmer POS tagging using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Since the features greatly affect the tagging accuracy, we investigate five groups of features and use them with the CRF model. First, we study different contextual information and use it as our baseline model. We then analyze the characteristics of Khmer and come up with three additional groups of language-related features including morphemes, word-shapes and name-entities. We also explore the use of lexicon as features to further improve the accuracy of our tagger. Our proposed approach has been evaluated on a corpus of 41,058 words and 27 POS tags.

The CMFs with diameters of 20–80 nm and lengths in the order of microns were isolated from wood sawdust. The purpose of the present study was to find a simple method to overcome the problems associated with feeding and aggregation of the nanoscale fibers in PLA melt. Two fiber carriers were compared, that is, natural rubber (NR) latex and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a molecular weight of 4000 g mol−1. The results showed that with the aid of carrier, CMFs were successfully dispersed in the composites, enabling the strong reinforcing action of the fibrils to be realized. The type of carriers used had significant effects on the final properties of the PLA composites. Dynamic mechanical analysis results showed an eightfold improvement in modulus at elevated temperature (90°C) for the composite with 3 wt% CMFs using PEG as carrier. This enhancement was attributed to the combined effects of fiber reinforcement and cold crystallization induced in the PLA. With NR latex as carrier, the composite of high tensile strength was achieved by introducing the epoxidized rubber (ENR) in a ratio of 2:3 (ENR:NR) as a compatibilizer to improve adhesion between phases in the composites. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.",cellulose; melt-mixing; nanocomposites; Polylactic acid; properties,Cellulose; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Fibers; Latexes; Nanocomposites; Polyesters; Polyethylene glycols; Reinforcement; Rubber; Rubber compounding; Tensile strength; Cellulose microfibrils; Cold crystallization; Elevated temperature; High-tensile strength; Melt mixing; Natural rubber latex; Poly lactic acid; properties; Polyethylenes,Article in Press

However, it remains unanswered whether omalizumab modifies a CSU course. We aimed to study a course of CSU after omalizumab treatment in an Asian population. Medical records of recalcitrant CSU patients who attended Siriraj Hospital between 2013 and 2017 were reviewed. All patients receiving omalizumab treatment were followed after the first injection for at least 1 year. Of 15 patients receiving omalizumab treatment, 11 patients (73.3%) responded well to 150 mg while the rest required 300 mg. The median follow-up period was 18 months (range, 13.5–25.3). Three patterns of response were proposed and measured: excellent (disease remission over than 6 months) was found in 20%; good (injection interval extended longer than 6 months) was found in 27%; and modest (frequently required injections) was found in 53%. The mean duration of complete remission was 33 weeks (range, 26–38). Two-thirds of patients had disease relapse and required omalizumab injections to control symptoms. The other third did not show relapses for at least 69 weeks of the follow-up period. After 1 year of treatment, Kaplan–Meier curves estimated that a higher percentage (86.7%) of recalcitrant CSU patients receiving omalizumab treatment would be free of symptoms (weekly Urticaria Activity Score = 0) without prednisolone and/or cyclosporin as compared with 42% of patients not receiving omalizumab treatment. In conclusion, patients seem to be easily and safely manageable with omalizumab. Prednisolone and cyclosporin could be discontinued in all patients.

Objective: To identify potential risk factors for early recurrence of HCC after hepatic resection. Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent curative hepatic resection for HCC at our institute between January 2006 and December 2015 were reviewed retrospectively and risk factors for early recurrence were analyzed. Results: Two hundred ninety one patients were enrolled in the present study, of whom 146 (50.1%) developed tumor recurrence. Seventy-five patients (51.3%) developed recurrence within one year of surgery (early recurrence group) and 71 (48.6%) developed recurrence more than one year after surgery (late recurrence group).

When positive results are found, colonoscopy is necessary to find pathologic lesion. However, in many patients, nothing can be identified in the colon or rectum. In this situation some surgeons prefer to perform bidirectional endoscopy to search for the source of the bleeding. Currently, there is no standard guideline or recommendation to support this, nor is there evidence against it. Objective: To determine the predictive value of upper gastrointestinal pathology and benefits of routine use of esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD] after negative colonoscopy in positive FOBT. Materials and Methods: A retrospective medical records review between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016. All patients who had FOBT for screening colorectal cancer and positive results were included in the present study. Patients had undergone colonoscopy and EGD on the same day in the surgery unit and had negative finding in complete colonoscopy. The exclusion criteria were active gastrointestinal bleeding, pre-existing gastrointestinal disease, and previous gastrointestinal tract surgery. Results: From the method, 185 patients with negative colonoscopy were enrolled. The mean age was 62.57 years. There were 145 females (78.38%) and 40 males (21.62%). In 160 patients who had pathological lesion from EGD, we found 117 cases (73.13%) with gastritis and no patients with gastric cancer. In 160 patients, there were 25 cases (15.63%) with dyspepsia. Of the 25 dyspepsia patients, there were 18 cases (69.23%) who had Helicobacter pylori infection. Conclusion: EGD has a higher yield for diagnosing benign lesions, but not for gastric cancer, in FOBT-positive patients. Dual endoscopy may be cost effective in terms of early treatment and the reduced chance of future problems. In some patients, we diagnosed and eradicated H. pylori, therefore reducing the risk of gastric cancer. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics, photobiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes of CAD patients in Thailand. Materials and Methods: The present study was cross-sectional retrospective chart review conducted in patients that underwent phototesting at the Photodermatology clinic of Siriraj Hospital between 1997 and 2013. Data were collected from patient medical records and follow-up telephone interviews. Complete response was defined as 100% clinical improvement, and partial response was defined as 25% to 99% clinical improvement. Results: Forty-five patients were included, of which 39 (86%) were male and six (14%) were female. The mean age was 57.5 (range 28 to 84) years. More than half of patients (51%) had decreased minimal erythema dose [MED] to both ultraviolet [UV] A and UVB, while 18 patients (40%) had decreased MED to UVB alone and four patients (9%) had decreased MED to UVA alone. Eleven patients (24%) had extensive skin involvement beyond the sun-exposed area. All patients showed some degree of clinical improvement after initiation of photoprotection and medical treatment. Analysis of clinical course was available in 35 patients, with a mean ± standard deviation follow-up duration of 24.5 (range 1 to 72) months. Six patients (17%) achieved complete response and 29 patients (83%) showed partial response to treatment. In the complete response group, the mean duration of disease was 19.67±15.15 (range 3 to 40) months and no systemic medication was required. Systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants were required in severe patients, particularly in patients who had exfoliative dermatitis or leonine facies. In patients with recalcitrant facial lesions, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment showed a promising response. Conclusion: CAD had a chronic course in the present study and only a minority of patients achieved complete response.

An application of the proposed method is illustrated in the automatic palmistry system. Both hardware and software are created and tested. The system can detect palm and three main lines, i.e., life line, heart line, and brain line. Line’s position, line’s length, and line’s curvature are used for palmistry prediction. These three lines will be compared to the lines in the line pattern archives by using the nearest neighbor method. The experimental results show that this system can detect palm and palm’s lines and this system yields the suitable results on many examples. Furthermore, the concept of this system can be applied to identification and authentication in security approaches or in the embedded system fields. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Image processing; Line detection; Nearest neighbor; Palm detection; Palmistry,Image processing; Natural language processing systems; Software testing; Hardware and software; Image processing technique; Line detection; Nearest neighbor method; Nearest neighbors; Palmistry; Prediction systems; Security approach; Palmprint recognition,Conference Paper

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of macrophage and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration in tissues obtained from women with adenomyosis who did or did not receive oral progestin dienogest. Materials and Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trial study, 24 patients with adenomyosis who required hysterectomy were enrolled. Twelve patients received dienogest 28-35 days before surgery, and the other 12 patients were not treated with any hormones. The endometrial and myometrial tissue samples were immediately collected after hysterectomy, and immunohistochemistry for a macrophage marker (CD68) and a NK cells marker (CD57) was performed. Results: The number of CD57 cells was significantly increased in endometrial glands of the treated group compared to the untreated group (P=0.005) but not in stroma in the endometrium of the treated patients (P=0.416). The difference in the number of CD68 cells was not statistically significant between treated and untreated groups in the endometrial glands (P=0.055) or stromal tissues (P=0.506). Conclusion: Administration of oral progestin dienogest to patients with adenomyosis increased the number of uterine infiltrating NK cells in glandular structure of eutopic endometrium. The differential effects of progestin on NK cells depended on the site of immune cell infiltration. The effects of oral progestin on uterine NK cells in adenomyosis have the potentials to be beneficial to pregnancies occurring following discontinuation of treatment in terms of embryo implantation and fetal protection (Registration number: TCTR20150921001). © 2017, Royan Institute (ACECR).

GLASS is a surveillance system for clinical specimens that are sent to microbiology laboratory for clinical purposes. The unique feature of GLASS is that clinical data is combined with microbiological data, and deduplication of the microbiological results is performed. The objective of the study was to determine feasibility and benefit of GLASS for surveillance of blood culture specimens. GLASS was implemented at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand using a locally developed web application program (app) to transfer blood culture specimen data, and to enter clinical data of patients with positive blood culture by infection control nurses and physicians via the app installed in their smart phones. The rate of positive blood culture specimens with true infection was 15.2%. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of bacteremia. Secondary bacteremia, primary bacteremia, and central line-associated blood stream infection was observed in 61.8%, 30.6%, and 12.6% of cases, respectively. Sepsis was observed in 56.9% of patients. E.coli was significantly more common in community-acquired bacteremia, whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii were significantly more common in hospital-acquired bacteremia. Hospital-acquired isolates of E.coli, K.pneumoniae, A.baumannii, P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and Enterococcus faecium were more resistant to antibiotics than community-acquired isolates. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with antibiotic-resistant bacteremia than in patients with antibiotic non-resistant bacteremia (40.5% vs. 28.5%, p<0.001). The patients with antibiotic-resistant bacteremia consumed more resources than those with antibiotic non-resistant bacteremia. Blood culture results combined with patient clinical data were shown to have more benefit for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, and to be more applicable for developing local antibiotic treatment guidelines for patients suspected of having bacteremia. However, GLASS consumed more time and more resources than the conventional laboratory-based surveillance system. © 2018 Sirijatuphat et al.

Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional study of fifteen patients with an history of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to common BL drug group, at Ramathibodi Hospital between 2010 and 2012. All subjects underwent ST, and DPT if ST was negative. BAT was done in all patients. Results: Fifteen patients (10 children and 5 adult), including seven male and eight female cases with history of highly indicated immediate type allergic reactions to beta lactam were examined. Five presented with anaphylaxis and 10 with urticarial rash/ angioedema. From fifteen patients, eight patients were confirmed allergic to BL, where four had ST positivity, and four had positive DPT. The present study found one patient with severe anaphylaxis that had negative ST, but could not undergo DPT due to underlying diseases. The alternative test BAT yielded positive result. Four of the eight patients were confirmed as BL allergic patients with positive BAT (50%). None of the patients with negative drug testing had positive BAT. Estimated sensitivity of ST was similar to BAT at 50%, while specificity of BAT in the present study was 100%. The result yielded higher sensitivity, such as 62%, when we combined both tests together (ST and BAT). The authors observed BAT positive results in 75% of patients with positive ST, and 25% of patients positive DPT. Conclusion: BAT has an advantage in patients contraindicated to perform DPT. Moreover, BAT can avoid the risk of reproducible reactions from in vivo testing, especially in high-risk patients allergic to BL. BAT is a promising alternate investigation tool ensuring patients’ safety. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

Approximately, two-thirds of breast cancers are positive for estrogen receptor (ERs), which is a predisposing factor for the growth of breast cancer cells. As such, ERα represents a lucrative therapeutic target for breast cancer that has attracted wide interest in the search for inhibitory agents. However, the conventional laboratory processes are cost- and time-consuming. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop alternative methods such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting ER-mediated endocrine agitation as to simplify their prioritization for future screening. In this study, we compiled and curated a large, non-redundant data set of 1231 compounds with ERα inhibitory activity (pIC50). Using comprehensive validation tests, it was clearly observed that the model utilizing the substructure count as descriptors, performed well considering two objectives: using less descriptors for model development and achieving high predictive performance (RTr 2 = 0.94, QCV 2 = 0.73, and QExt 2 = 0.73). It is anticipated that our proposed QSAR model may become a useful high-throughput tool for identifying novel inhibitors against ERα. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Diseases; Molecular graphics; Breast cancer cells; Inhibitory activity; Laboratory process; Physiological functions; Predictive performance; Predisposing factors; Quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR); Therapeutic targets; Computational chemistry,Article

The IOP adsorbent had specific surface area of 65 m2/g, total pore volume of 0.25 cm3/g and mostly contained a mesoporous structure. The analysis of scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicated that the adsorbent contained a substantial amount of iron oxide of about 66%, which was well distributed throughout the adsorbent. The IOP adsorbent showed a rapid and efficient Cr(VI) removal that followed Langmuir adsorption isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacity of 2.39 mg-Cr(VI)/g-IOP, demonstrating a monolayer formation on the adsorptive sites of IOP. The kinetic adsorption of Cr(VI) on the IOP followed the pseudo-second-order model, suggesting chemisorption.

However, serogroup O1/O139 strains are rarely isolated from their ecological sources. Quite plausibly, the non-O1/non-O139 vibrios and other bacterial species suppress growth of O1/O139 strains that share the same niche. Our bacterial inhibition assay data indicated that certain non-O1/non-O139 strains used a contact-dependent type VI secretion system (T6SS) to suppress growth of the O1 El Tor, N16961 pandemic strain. Comparative proteomics of the O1 and the suppressive non-O1/non-O139 strains co-cultured in a simulated natural aquatic microcosm showed that SecB and HlyD were upregulated in the latter. The HlyD-related effective factor was subsequently found to be hemolysin A (HlyA). However, not all hlyA-positive non-O1/non-O139 strains mediated growth suppression of the N16961 V. cholerae; only strains harboring intact cluster I HlyA could exert this activity. The key feature of the HlyA is located in the ricin-like lectin domain (β-trefoil) that plays an important role in target cell binding. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae suppressed the growth of the O1 pandemic strain by using contact-dependent T6SS as well as by secreting the O1-detrimental hemolysin A during their co-persistence in the aquatic habitat. © FEMS 2017.",bacterial competition; Ecological niche; Growth suppressive factor; Hemolysin A; Non O1/non-O139 Vibrio cholerae; O1/O139 Vibrio cholerae,aquatic environment; bacterium; bioassay; cell; competition (ecology); growth; habitat type; inhibition; microbial activity; microbial ecology; microcosm; protein; proteomics; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lotus; Vibrio cholerae,Article

Aims: To establish normal HRM values for Thai people in both supine and upright positions. Methods: Forty-one healthy subjects were recruited, each of whom underwent solid-state HRM with ten 5-mL swallows of water in both the supine and upright positions. Measuring parameters according to the Chicago classification criteria (CC v3.0) were included, for which the mean, median and 5th and 95th percentiles (PCTLs) were calculated. Results: The results corresponded with the CC v3.0 criteria, except for the mean, and 5th PCTL of the distal contractile integral (DCI), which were lower for this population. In the upright position, the mean and median values for DCI, intrabolus pressure and integrated relaxation pressure were significantly decreased, whereas the length of the transitional zone was significantly increased. The limitations of this study include: (1) the relatively low number of participants, (2) the limited recruitment of participants only at Ramathibodi Hospital and (3) the limited recruitment of only young and middle-aged participants. Conclusions: We established normal values for the HRM parameters in a representative sample of the Thai population. Our supine results still prove that the use of the CC v3.0 is preferable.

Pyronaridine-artesunate combination could be one of the choices for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in multidrug-resistant areas including Thailand. The aim of this study was to determine in vitro sensitivity and crossresistance pattern of pyronaridine in Thai isolates of P. falciparum. In addition, the influence of resistant genes concerning in vitro pyronaridine sensitivity was determined. The mean pyronaridine 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 118 parasite isolates was 5.6±3.1 nM (range = 0.2-15.4 nM) with a significant positive correlation with artesunate IC50 (r = 0.246, P = 0.008) and amodiaquine IC50 (r = 0.220, P = 0.042) and a significant negative correlation with quinine IC50 (r =-0.185, P = 0.047).

Asymptomatic brain abnormalities were recorded in some countries but the data in Thailand were limited. Objective: To evaluate asymptomatic NMOSD brain abnormalities and their relation to clinical relapses in Thai patients. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study, recruiting 27 NMOSD patients in a tertiary care center in Thailand. All patients were seropositive for aquaporin-4 IgG. Magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the brain was performed in every case. Results: Twenty-four cases (88.89%) had asymptomatic hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images [FLAIR]. These lesions were widespread across the brain even in areas with low density of aquaporin-4. To our knowledge, a fornix lesion was reported for the first time in a patient with acute optic neuritis. By using linear regression analysis, no significant correlation between annual relapse rate [ARR] and the number of asymptomatic FLAIR hyperintensities was established (coefficient 0.02, 95% confidence interval -0.0009 to 0.04, p = 0.06). Conclusion: Asymptomatic FLAIR hyperintensities on brain MRIs are frequently found in NMOSD. They may not correlate with clinical relapses. Further cohort studies are required.

Ear piercing is one of the most popular body ornamentation that could somehow lead to keloid formation. Objective: To identify any risk factors that may relate to post-ear piercing keloid formation. Materials and Methods: This case control study was conducted in Thai people at Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery at Ramathibodi Hospital between August 2015 and August 2016. It consisted of post-ear piercing subjects with and without keloid formation as case (43 subjects) and control (44 subjects) groups respectively. Information regarding age at piercing, history of keloid formed, age of keloid formation, site of piercing, method for piercing, jewelry use after piercing, complications, development of keloid at other location of the body, family history of keloid, and skin color was collected. Results: According to the study, complications from piercing such as infection or allergic reaction were significantly related to post-ear piercing keloid formation (p<0.001). Piercing through cartilage was also proven to be one of the major risk factors (p<0.001). There was no difference between cases and controls in terms of age at piercing, method for piercing, use of jewelry, keloid at other location of the body, family history of keloid, and skin color.

Complications arising from SCD include anemia, microvascular occlusion, severe pain, stokes, renal dysfunction and infections. A lucrative therapeutic strategy is to employ anti-sickling agents that can disrupt the formation of the HbS polymer. This study therefore employed cheminformatic approaches, encompassing classification structure-activity relationship (CSAR) modeling, to deduce the privileged substructures giving rise to the anti-sickling activity of an investigated set of 115 compounds, followed by substructure analysis. Briefly, the compiled compounds were described by fingerprint descriptors and used in the construction of CSAR models via several machine learning algorithms. The modelability of the data set, as exemplified by the MODI index, was determined to be in the range of 0.70-0.84. The predictive performance was deduced by the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthews correlation coefficient, which was found to be statistically robust, whereby the former three parameters afforded values in excess of 0.7 while the latter statistical parameter provided a value greater than 0.5. An analysis of the top 20 important substructure descriptors for anti-sickling activity revealed that 10 important features were significant in the differentiation of actives from inactives, as illustrated by aromaticity/conjugation (e.g. SubFPC287, SubFPC171 and SubFPC5), carbonyl groups (e.g. SubFPC137, SubFPC139, SubFPC49 and SubFPC135) and miscellaneous groups (e.g. SubFPC303, SubFPC302 and SubFPC275). Furthermore, an analysis of the structure-activity relationship revealed that the length of alkyl chains, choice of functional moiety and position of substitution on the benzene ring may affect the anti-sickling activity of these compounds. Thus, this knowledge is anticipated to be useful for guiding the design of robust compounds against the gelling activity of HbS, as preliminarily demonstrated in the data-driven compound design presented herein. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Functional polymers; Health; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Structures (built objects); Classification structure; Correlation coefficient; Predictive performance; Statistical parameters; Structure activity relationships; Substructure analysis; Therapeutic strategy; World Health Organization; Structural design,Article

In addition, intraoperative hyperoxia in general is reviewed, as its beneficial effect on SSI is only one aspect proven for certain surgical groups only, such as patients with colorectal and major vascular surgery. It would be consequent recommending the application of pure oxygen (100%), most of all as it means maximal simplification of general anaesthesia thus resulting in significantly improving patients’ safety. Confusing different gases, such as oxygen and nitrous oxide with fatal consequences is impossible. In addition, the physiologic oxygen storage is optimized, and the lowest possible flow (150-300 ml/min) can be applied. Speculations that ventilating patients with high oxygen during surgery may be harmful, mainly based on experimental data or observations in ICU patients are opposed by numerous randomized clinical trials reporting beneficial effects of intraoperative hyperoxia on postoperative morbidity.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) during the 25 May 2014–28 November 2014 study period. Patients who presented with crystal-induced acute arthritis were eligible for inclusion. Diagnosis of gout or pseudogout was made by microscopic visualization and analysis of crystals in synovial fluid. Patients with other causes of acute arthritis were excluded. Patients diagnosed with gout were compared with patients diagnosed with pseudogout and factors with a p value less than 0.05 were included in logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 103 patients were included. Gout and pseudogout were established in 59 (56.7%) and 44 (42.3%) patients, respectively. Gout patients were younger than pseudogout patients (66.9 ± 14.5 vs. 78.9 ± 12.0 years; p = 0.0001); had higher BMI (22.9 ± 2.5 vs. 21.0 ± 2.5 kg/m2; p = 0.001); had history of recurrent arthritis (91.5 vs. 9.1%; p = 0.001); had higher prevalence of below-knee arthritis (66.1 vs. 31.8%; p = 0.001); had less periarticular soft tissue swelling (57.6 vs. 81.8%; p = 0.01); and had hyperuricemia (8.0 ± 2.5 vs. 5.6 ± 2.7; p = 0.001).

These drugs increased bleeding complications in CIED implantations. Currently, we have no data on device-related bleeding complications [DRBCs] among Thai patients receiving OACs and/or antiplatelet therapy prior to CIED implantation. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who underwent CIED implantations and continued to follow-up at the Siriraj Device Clinic in 2016. The baseline characteristics, comorbidities, types of CIED, CIED indications, types of antithrombotic and DRBCs data were collected. Siriraj protocol requires that patients follow-up at the device clinic 12 to 16 days post implantation and be evaluated for DRBCs by two device-clinic staff. If DRBCs are detected, a caliper is used to measure the size in three dimensions. Our primary outcome is the incidence of DRBCs among patients who received antithrombotic drugs and the secondary outcome is the incidence of DRBCs for each group of antithrombotic drugs. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board [IRB]. Results: Three hundred patients underwent CIEDs implantations then continued follow-up at the device clinic between January and December 2016; their mean age was 69.7±14.5 years, and 60.3% were male. The implanted CIEDs consisted of pacemakers (59.7%), automated implantable cardioverter defibrillators (AICDs, 28.3%) and cardiac resynchronization therapy device (CRTs, 12%). Antithrombotic used, found in 73% (218) of the implanted CIED patients, was distributed into the following groups, single-antiplatelet therapy (SAPT, 31%, 93), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT, 13%, 39), OAC plus antiplatelet (9.7%, 29), triple therapy (DAPT plus OAC, 1.3%, 4), warfarin (14.7%, 44) and non-vitamin K antagonist OAC (NOAC, 3%, 9). The primary outcome showed a DRBC incidence of 12.8% among patients using antithrombotics. Of those patients, the DRBCs detected 9.7% (9) of patients in the SAPT group, 15.4% (6) in the DAPT group, 13.8% (4) in the OAC-plus-antiplatelet group and 20.5% (9) in the warfarin group. No DRBCs were detected in either the no-antithrombotic group (82) or the NOAC group (9). However, almost all the DRBC patients resolved spontaneously without intervention. Unfortunately, one DRBCs patient who only took aspirin (81 mg) was admitted for a hematoma evacuation. The different in size of the CIED revealed a significant correlation in the incidence of DRBCs, as shown in the analysis, the CRTD-implanted patients had more DRBCs than the pacemaker-implanted patients (OR 4.36, 95% CI 1.61 to 11.8, p-value 0.004). Moreover, a multivariate analysis demonstrated an increased level of DRBCs among patients in the CAD and warfarin groups (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.01 to 11.5, p-value 0.048) and (OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.17 to 7.46, p-value 0.022) respectively. Surprisingly, the level of DRBCs was decreased among patients who had used statins in the non-CAD group (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.80, p-value 0.024). Conclusion: A comparison of CIED-implantation patients who had been using and had not been using antithrombotic drugs prior to surgery revealed that, although the incidence of DRBCs increased when antithrombotics were used, those DRBCs were still not clinically significant as they resolved spontaneously without the need for treatment. This finding supports the safety of continuing to use antithrombotic drugs on patients undergoing CIEDs implantations. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

Objective: To identify the predictors of unresectable proximal cholangiocarcinoma in era of modern imaging. Materials and Methods: Between January 2012 and April 2017, patients who had potentially curative resection and underwent laparotomy for proximal cholangiocarcinoma were evaluated. The 60 patients were categorized into two groups, resectable and unresectable group. Results: For an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [ICC] group of 18-unresectable and 27-resectable patients, there were significantly higher levels of alkaline phosphatase [ALP] (328.4 versus 148.8 U/L, p = 0.002), gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT] (364.1 versus 179.9U/L, p = 0.015) and a higher number of patients with N2-enlarged lymph nodes [LN] greater than 1 cm from imaging (27.8% versus 0%, p = 0.004) in unresectable group. For a perihilar cholangiocarcinoma [PHC] group of 5-unresectable and 10-resectable patients, there was a higher number of patients with N2-enlarged LN greater than 1 cm from imaging (40.0% versus 0%, p = 0.032) in unresectable group. According to univariate analysis, ALP and GGT of resectable group and unresectable group were significantly different by using cut-off level of ALP at 150 U/L (odds ratio 0.240, p = 0.028) and GGT level at 240 U/L (odds ratio 0.154, p = 0.005). The GGT was the only one independent predictor by using cut-off level at 240 U/L (odds ratio 0.154, p = 0.13). The area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve of GGT was 0.7127.

However, studies of the quantitative measurement of FPHL are still limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of hair density and hair diameter in normal women and FPHL patients, and further correlate the quantitative measurement with the clinical presentation of FPHL. Patients and methods: An evaluation of 471 FPHL patients and 236 normal women was carried out according to the Ludwig classification, and analysis was performed by using a computerized handheld USB camera with computer-assisted software. Various areas of the scalp, including frontal, parietal, midscalp, and occipital, were analyzed for hair density, non-vellus hair diameter, and percentage of miniaturized hair. Results: The hair density in normal women was the highest and the lowest in the midscalp and parietal areas, respectively. The FPHL group revealed the lowest hair density in the parietal area. Significant differences in hair density, non-vellus hair diameter, and percentage of miniaturized hair between the normal and FPHL groups were observed, especially in the midscalp and parietal areas. Conclusion: The parietal area is another important affected area in FPHL in addition to the midscalp area.

Outcome assessment is an essential component of any system that provides formative feedback, which requires assessing the outcome, relating it to the procedure, and communicating in a language natural to dental students. This study takes a first step toward automated generation of such comprehensive feedback. Methods: Virtual reference templates are computed based on tooth anatomy and the outcome is assessed with a 3D score cube volume which consists of voxel-level non-linear weighted scores based on the templates. The detailed scores are transformed into standard scoring language used by dental schools. The system was evaluated on fifteen outcome samples that contained optimal results and those with errors including perforation of the walls, floor, and both, as well as various combinations of major and minor over and under drilling errors. Five endodontists who had professional training and varying levels of experiences in root canal treatment participated as raters in the experiment. Results: Results from evaluation of our system with expert endodontists show a high degree of agreement with expert scores (information based measure of disagreement 0.04-0.21). At the same time they show some disagreement among human expert scores, reflecting the subjective nature of human outcome scoring. The discriminatory power of the AOS scores analyzed with three grade tiers (A, B, C) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC values are generally highest for the {AB: C} cutoff which is cutoff at the boundary between clinically acceptable (B) and clinically unacceptable (C) grades. Conclusions: The objective consistency of computed scores and high degree of agreement with experts make the proposed system a promising addition to existing VR simulators. The translation of detailed level scores into terminology commonly used in dental surgery supports natural communication with students and instructors. With the reference virtual templates created automatically, the approach is robust and is applicable in scoring the outcome of any dental surgery procedure involving the act of drilling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Automated outcome assessment; Formative assessment; Intelligent tutoring; Surgical simulation; Virtual reality,Automation; Dental cutting tools; Dentistry; Personnel training; Simulators; Surgery; Teaching; Virtual addresses; Virtual reality; Formative assessment; Intelligent tutoring; Natural communication; Outcome assessment; Professional training; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Surgical simulation; Virtual reality simulator; Surgical equipment; Article; automation; constructive feedback; controlled study; dental education; dental student; endodontic surgery; endodontist; human; mastoidectomy; operation duration; outcome assessment; receiver operating characteristic; surgical training; tooth extraction; tooth root canal; virtual reality,Article

Methods: The monoclone, namely 88F2-3F4, was produced from hybridoma technology. The specificity of antibody secreted from 88F2-3F4 was tested against other Gram negative bacteria frequently found in gastrointestinal tract. Then the antibody was used for searching Aeromonas antigens in artificial seeded rectal swab cultures by dot-blot enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results: 88F2-3F4 produced an antibody that recognized an antigen with a molecular mass of 8.5 kDa in all 123 isolates of the seven Aeromonas species tested, but recognized no epitope of any other Gram-negative bacterium typically found in the gastrointestinal tract. A dot-blot enzyme linked immunosorbent assay based on this antibody showed 86.49% sensitivity and 92.13% specificity. Conclusions: 88F2-3F4 monoclonal antibody could react with all Aeromonas isolates, but not other Gram negative bacteria, therefore it should be a useful tool for the detection of Aeromonas antigen in clinical and environmental samples. © 2018 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine Produced by Wolters Kluwer- Medknow.",Aeromonas; Gastrointestinal tract; Immunodiagnosis; Monoclonal antibody,88F2 3F4 monoclonal antibody; Aeromonas antigen; bacterial antigen; monoclonal antibody; unclassified drug; Aeromonas hydrophila; animal cell; antibody production; antibody specificity; Article; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; clinical assessment tool; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; dot blot enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; gastroenteritis; gastrointestinal tract; infant; molecular weight; mouse; nonhuman; predictive value; priority journal; rectal swab culture; sensitivity and specificity; serodiagnosis; spleen cell; wound infection,Article

We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant acellular pertussis vaccine containing genetically inactivated pertussis toxin and filamentous haemagglutinin, as either a monovalent vaccine (aP[PTgen/FHA]) or in combination with tetanus and reduced-dose diphtheria vaccines (TdaP[PTgen/FHA]), versus a licensed tetanus and reduced-dose diphtheria and acellular pertussis combination vaccine (Tdap). Methods We did this phase 2/3, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial at two sites in Bangkok, Thailand. Healthy adolescents (aged 12–17 years) were randomly assigned (1:1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation list with block sizes of three, to receive one dose (0·5 mL) of aP(PTgen/FHA), TdaP(PTgen/FHA), or Tdap (comparator). Clinical research staff responsible for participant randomisation, vaccine preparation and administration, and accountability were aware of group allocation. However, allocation was concealed from all other site study staff, data management personnel, statisticians, laboratory staff, and study participants. The primary outcome was non-inferior immunogenicity of TdaP(PTgen/FHA) to Tdap based on seroconversion rates (a four-fold increase or more) for pertussis toxin and filamentous haemagglutinin IgG antibodies 28 days after vaccination, with a predefined 10% margin of equivalence. We did analysis by per protocol. This study is registered with the Thai Clinical Trial Registry, number TCTR20150703002. Findings Between July 6 and Aug 20, 2015, we allocated 450 participants to receive one dose of TdaP(PTgen/FHA) (n=150), aP(PTgen/FHA) (n=150), or comparator Tdap (n=150). 28 days after vaccination, seroconversion rates for anti-pertussis toxin IgG were 96·6% (95% CI 93·8–99·5; n=144) in the TdaP(PTgen/FHA) group and 55·0% (47·1–63·0; n=82) in the comparator Tdap group (difference 41·6%, 95% CI 33·1–50·1; p&lt;0·0001). Seroconversion rates for anti-filamentous haemagglutinin were 82·6% (95% CI 76·5–88·6; n=123) in the TdaP(PTgen/FHA) group and 54·4% (46·4–62·4; n=81) in the comparator group (difference 28·2%, 95% CI 18·1–38·2 p&lt;0·0001). 28 days after vaccination, seroconversion rates in the aP(PTgen/FHA) group were 96·0% (95% CI 92·8–99·1; n=142) for anti-pertussis toxin IgG and 93·2% (89·2–97·3; n=138) for anti-filamentous haemagglutinin IgG. These findings support the non-inferior immunogenicity of TdaP(PTgen/FHA) over comparator Tdap. Reactogenicity and incidence of adverse events were similar between groups. Interpretation The new TdaP(PTgen/FHA) vaccine is safe and induces higher pertussis responses 28 days after vaccination than does the available licensed Tdap booster vaccine. Results of our trial led to the licensure of new acellular pertussis vaccines containing genetically inactivated pertussis toxin in Thailand. The availability of recombinant monovalent pertussis vaccines that induce high antibody responses provides the medical community and consumers with the opportunity to vaccinate against pertussis when immunisation against diphtheria and tetanus is not required or not desired. Studies are underway to pave the way for licensure studies of this acellular pertussis vaccine in other countries.

Migrant women in resource-poor settings may be at increased risk, yet little research has been conducted in low-income and middle-income settings. This prospective cohort study of migrant women on the Thai-Myanmar border aims to establish prevalence of perinatal depression, identify risk factors for perinatal depression and examine associations with infant outcomes. Participants Participating women are labour migrants and refugees living on the Thai-Myanmar border. A total of 568 women were recruited in their first trimester of pregnancy and are being followed up to 1-year postpartum. Findings to date At baseline, women in our study had a median age of 25 years, the predominant ethnicity was Sgaw Karen (48.9%), agriculture was the main employment sector (39.2%) and educational attainment was low with a median of 4 years of education. In the first trimester of pregnancy, a quarter (25.8%; 95% CI 22.3 to 29.5) of all women were depressed as diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of DSM-IV Disorders. Future plans Follow-up is ongoing and expected to continue until January 2018. The prevalence of depression at later stages of pregnancy and during the first postpartum year will be identified, and associations between depression status and demographic, social, migration-related, medical, obstetric and infant factors will be quantified.

Melatonin, a hormone mainly secreted by the pineal gland, is another anti-aging agent associated with the SIRT1-FOXOs pathway. This study aimed to compare the effects of melatonin (Mel) and caloric restriction (CR) on the expression of Sirt1, FoxO1, FoxO3a and FOXOs target genes in the aging mouse hippocampus. Neuropeptide Y-knockout (NpyKO) and wild-type (WT) male mice aged 19 months were previously treated either with food ad libitum or CR for 16 months. WT old animals were divided into four groups: control, CR, Mel and CR+Mel treated groups. The Mel and CR+Mel were treated with melatonin 10 mg/kg, daily, subcutaneously for 7 consecutive days. Mel treatment upregulated the mRNA expression of Sirt1, FOXOs (FoxO1 and FoxO3a) target genes that regulated the cell cycle [e.g., cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27)], Wingless and INT-1 (Wnt1) and inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (Wisp1) in the aged mouse hippocampus. CR treatment also showed the similar actions. However, the mRNA expression of Sirt1, FoxO1, FoxO3a, p27 or Wisp1 did not alter in the CR+Mel group when compared with CR or Mel group. Melatonin could not produce any additive effect on the CR treatment group, suggesting that both treatments mimicked the effect, possibly via the same pathway. NPY which mediates physiological adaptations to energy deficits is an essential link between CR and longevity in mice. In order to focus on the role of Npy in mediating the effects of melatonin, the gene expression between NpyKO and WT male mice were compared. Our data showed that, in the absence of Npy, melatonin could not mediate effects on those gene expressions, suggesting that Npy was required for melatonin to mediate the effect, possibly, on life extension. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Aging; Caloric restriction; FoxO1; Melatonin; Neuropeptide Y; Sirtuin1,cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; growth factor; melatonin; messenger RNA; neuropeptide Y; protein p27; sirtuin 1; transcription factor FKHR; transcription factor FKHRL1; transcription factor FOXO; unclassified drug; wisp1 protein; Wnt1 protein; aged; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; caloric restriction; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; food; gene expression; gene targeting; hippocampus; in vivo study; longevity; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; wild type,Article

B. thailandensis, some strains of which express a B. pseudomallei-like capsular polysaccharide (BTCV), is also commonly found in the environment in Southeast Asia but is considered non-pathogenic. The aim of the study was to determine the distribution of B. thailandensis and its capsular variant in Thailand and investigate whether its presence is associated with a serological response to B. pseudomallei. Methodology/principal findings: We evaluated the presence of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis in 61 rice fields in Northeast (n = 21), East (n = 19) and Central (n = 21) Thailand. We found BTCV in rice fields in East and Central but not Northeast Thailand. Fourteen fields were culture positive for B. pseudomallei alone, 8 for B. thailandensis alone, 11 for both B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis, 6 for both B. thailandensis and BTCV, and 5 for B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and BTCV. Serological testing using the indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) of 96 farmers who worked in the study fields demonstrated that farmers who worked in B. pseudomallei-positive fields had higher IHA titers than those who worked in B. pseudomallei-negative fields (median 1:40 [range: <1:10–1:640] vs. <1:10 [range: <1:10–1:320], p = 0.002). In a multivariable ordered logistic regression model, IHA titers were significantly associated with the presence of B. pseudomallei (aOR = 3.7; 95% CI 1.8–7.8, p = 0.001) but were not associated with presence of B. thailandensis (p = 0.32) or BTCV (p = 0.32). One sequence type (696) was identified for the 27 BTCV isolates tested. Conclusions/significance: This is the first report of BTCV in Thailand. The presence of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis in the same field was not uncommon. Our findings suggest that IHA positivity of healthy rice farmers in Thailand is associated with the presence of B. pseudomallei in rice fields rather than B. thailandensis or BTCV. © 2018 Hantrakun et al.",,bacterial polysaccharide; adult; aged; Article; bacterial load; bacterium identification; Burkholderia pseudomallei; Burkholderia thailandensis; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; disease association; female; genetic variability; genotyping technique; geographic distribution; health survey; hemagglutination; human; latex agglutination test; male; nonhuman; physical chemistry; pilot study; protein expression; rice; seroprevalence; soil analysis; Thailand,Article

However, there are few reports regarding bone mineral density (BMD) among adolescents with nontransfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT). Indeed, only BMD data in patients with nontransfusion-dependent (NTD) β-thalassemia intermedia have been reported. No previous study has investigated BMD among adolescents with NTD hemoglobin (Hb) E/β-thalassemia. Objective: To determine the prevalence of low bone mass among adolescents with NTD Hb E/β-thalassemia and factors relating to low bone mass. Methods: We investigated BMD of lumbar spine (L2–L4; BMDLS) and total body (BMDTB), as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, in 22 adolescents (aged 13.2–20 years) with NTD Hb E/β-thalassemia. Results: Low bone mass was found to be 18.2% and 22.7% at the lumbar spine (BMDLS Z-score adjusted for bone age and height age) and 13.6% and 9.1% at the total body (BMDTB Z-score adjusted for bone age and height age). Patients with mean Hb level <8 g/dl were more likely to have low bone mass (BMDLS and BMDTB Z-scores adjusted for bone age) compared to those with Hb level ≥ 8 g/dl. Mean Hb level correlated with BMDLS and BMDTB Z-scores adjusted for bone age. Conclusion: We demonstrated that a low Hb level was associated with low bone mass among adolescents with NTD Hb E/β-thalassemia. A significant proportion of low bone mass among these patients highlights the importance of appropriate management, including red cell transfusion, vitamin D and calcium supplementation for improved long-term bone health. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",adolescents; bone mineral density; Hb E/β-thalassemia; nontransfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT); thalassemia,"25 hydroxyvitamin D; ferritin; hemoglobin; hemoglobin E; adolescent; anemia; Article; blood transfusion; bone age; bone density; bone length; bone mass; clinical article; comparative study; disease association; disease severity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; ferritin blood level; hemoglobin blood level; hemoglobin E-beta thalassemia; human; lumbar spine; male; prevalence; priority journal; vitamin blood level; adult; beta thalassemia; bone density; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; lumbar vertebra; metabolism; multicenter study; pathophysiology; photon absorptiometry; severity of illness index; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adolescent; Adult; beta-Thalassemia; Bone Density; Female; Hemoglobin E; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Severity of Illness Index",Article

Effective resuscitation reduces mortality and morbidity but long-term outcomes in resource-limited settings are poorly described. This study reports on newborn neurological outcomes following resuscitation at birth in a resource-limited setting where intensive newborn care including intubation is unavailable. Methods Retrospective analysis of births records from 2008 to 2015 at Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Findings From 21,225 newbonrs delivered, 15,073 (71%) met the inclusion criteria (liveborn, singleton, 28 weeks’ gestation, delivered in SMRU). Neonatal resuscitation was performed in 460 (3%; 422 basic, 38 advanced) cases. Overall early neonatal mortality was 6.6 deaths per 1000 live births (95% CI 5.40–8.06). Newborns receiving basic and advanced resuscitation presented an adjusted rate for death of 1.30 (95%CI 0.66–2.55; p = 0.442), and 6.32 (95%CI 3.01–13.26; p<0.001) respectively, compared to newborns given routine care. Main factors related to increased need for resuscitation were breech delivery, meconium, and fetal distress (p<0.001). Neurodevelopmental follow-up to one year was performed in 1,608 (10.5%) of the 15,073 newborns; median neurodevelopmental scores of non-resuscitated newborns and those receiving basic resuscitation were similar (64 (n = 1565) versus 63 (n = 41); p = 0.732), while advanced resuscitation scores were significantly lower (56 (n = 5); p = 0.017). Interpretations Newborns requiring basic resuscitation at birth have normal neuro-developmental outcomes at one year of age compared to low-risk newborns. Identification of risk factors (e.g., breech delivery) associated with increased need for neonatal resuscitation may facilitate allocation of staff to high-risk deliveries. This work endorses the use of basic resuscitation in low-resource settings, and supports on-going staff training to maintain bag-and-mask ventilation skills. © 2018 Janet et al.

The Zika virus was first discovered in 1947. It was neglected until a major outbreak occurred on Yap Island, Micronesia, in 2007. Teratogenic effects resulting in microcephaly in newborn infants is the greatest public health threat. In 2016, the Zika virus epidemic was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Consequently, mathematical models were constructed to explicitly elucidate related transmission dynamics. Survey Methodology. In this review article, two steps of journal article searching were performed. First, we attempted to identify mathematical models previously applied to the study of vector-borne diseases using the search terms ""dynamics,"" ""mathematical model,"" ""modeling,"" and ""vector-borne"" together with the names of vector-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria, West Nile, and Zika. Then the identified types of model were further investigated. Second, we narrowed down our survey to focus on only Zika virus research. The terms we searched for were ""compartmental,"" ""spatial,"" ""metapopulation,"" ""network,"" ""individual-based,"" ""agent-based"" AND ""Zika."" All relevant studies were included regardless of the year of publication. We have collected research articles that were published before August 2017 based on our search criteria. In this publication survey, we explored the Google Scholar and PubMed databases. Results. We found five basic model architectures previously applied to vector-borne virus studies, particularly in Zika virus simulations. These include compartmental, spatial, metapopulation, network, and individual-based models. We found that Zika models carried out for early epidemics were mostly fit into compartmental structures and were less complicated compared to the more recent ones. Simple models are still commonly used for the timely assessment of epidemics. Nevertheless, due to the availability of large-scale real-world data and computational power, recently there has been growing interest in more complex modeling frameworks. Discussion. Mathematical models are employed to explore and predict how an infectious disease spreads in the real world, evaluate the disease importation risk, and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. As the trends in modeling of infectious diseases have been shifting towards data-driven approaches, simple and complex models should be exploited differently. Simple models can be produced in a timely fashion to provide an estimation of the possible impacts. In contrast, complex models integrating real-world data require more time to develop but are far more realistic. The preparation of complicated modeling frameworks prior to the outbreaks is recommended, including the case of future Zika epidemic preparation. © 2018 Wiratsudakul et al.",Deterministic; Epidemic model; Import risk; Intervention; Stochastic; Zika,arthropod vector; Article; aviation; communicable disease; compartment model; Dengue virus; disease carrier; disease transmission; Ebolavirus; epidemic; fly bite; host; human; infection; mathematical model; metapopulation; microcephaly; migration; mosquito; nonhuman; risk assessment; sexual transmission; teratogenesis; virus transmission; Zika fever; Zika virus,Article

Design/methodology/approach - An integration of fuzzy set theory and ISM is proposed to maintain a higher level of consistency and reduce the uncertainty inherent in expert responses. Findings - RCP can be categorized into seven levels, which represent the driving power from higher to lower. The top aspect is management style; the remaining aspects are stakeholder management, regulation compliance, efficiency improvement, sustainable awareness, sustainable production and social responsibility. Research limitations/implications - This study attempts to integrate the triple bottom line (TBL) concept and corporate sustainability to develop a significant framework for evaluating RCP. Although the proposed aspects and criteria can be used to evaluate the Chinese construction industry, these may be insufficient for other industries. In addition, further discussion regarding important aspects and criteria is required to complete the theoretical basis. Practical implications - The results indicate that the top two criteria are establishing transparent communication channels and promoting managerial attitudes and behavior, which are followed by technology capabilities, organizational culture and stakeholder engagement. These five criteria play important roles when implementing RCP practices among Chinese construction firms.

Plant-pollinator interactions provide a convenient system to test such predictions because floral resources are often temporally patchy, thus requiring long-lived pollinators to switch resources seasonally. Furthermore, flowering phenologies range from ‘steady-state’ (low-rewarding but highly reliable) to ‘big-bang’ (high-rewarding but ephemeral) plant species. We assessed how nectarivorous Old World bats respond to this temporally variable floral environment by examining their diets throughout the year. Over 15 months of fieldwork in southern Thailand, we simultaneously: (1) recorded the flowering phenologies of six bat-pollinated plant taxa; and (2) assessed the diets of seven common flower-visiting bat species. As predicted, the generalist nectarivore (Eonycteris spelaea) frequently switched diets and utilized both big-bang and steady-state resources, while the specialist nectarivores (Macroglossus minimus and M. sobrinus) foraged on one or two steady-state plant species year-round. Our results suggest that larger and faster bat species are able to fly longer distances in search of big-bang resources, while smaller bat species rely on highly predictable food resources. This study supports the theory that generalist foragers have flexible diets, while specialist species restrict foraging to preferred floral resources even when other floral resources are more abundant. Moreover, these findings demonstrate how plant flowering phenology and pollinator diet breadth can shape the frequency and constancy of pollinator visits; we further discuss how such interactions can influence the potential extent of gene flow within a patchy floral environment. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation",big-bang resources; chiropterophily; diet switching; phenology; pollination; Pteropodidae; steady-state resources; Thailand,bat; dietary shift; flora; flower visiting; food preference; foraging behavior; generalist; nectarivory; niche breadth; phenology; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; resource availability; specialist; temporal variation; zoophily; Thailand; Eonycteris spelaea; Macroglossus minimus; Pteropodidae,Article

Given that insects are much smaller than bats, they may be more effective at transferring pollen for plant species with similar stamen and pistil lengths, such as the 'Monthong' durian cultivar. The present study clarifies the role of insects in pollinating the 'Monthong' cultivar by examining the floral biology, conducting pollination treatments on 19 trees and observing floral visitors in southern Thailand. Stigmas were receptive by 17h00, and over 50% of 'Monthong' anthers had dehisced by 17h30. Several bee species began foraging on flowers during the late afternoon, and the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) continued to visit throughout the night. Our results show that at 4 wk after pollination, the highest fruit set occurred from hand-crossed pollination (13.5%), followed by open pollination (5.5%), insect pollination (3.3%) and automatic autogamy (2.0%), indicating that this cultivar is highly self-incompatible. Moreover, insects appear to be important pollinators of 'Monthong' durian in areas where nectar bats visit infrequently. One bee species in particular, Apis dorsata, commonly foraged on flowers at dusk and appears to be the most effective insect pollinator of durian. Our findings highlight that nocturnally foraging bees are capable of securing pollination for night-blooming plant taxa, even those typically considered to be bat-pollinated. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.",Apis dorsata; Asian honey bee; Durio zibethinus; entomophily; giant honey bee; insect pollination; plant-pollinator interaction; stingless bee,Apis dorsata; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Durio zibethinus; Hexapoda; Meliponinae,Article

In the past decade, next-generation sequencing technologies have helped to facilitate the identification of multiple neuropeptide genes in a variety of taxa, including arthropods, molluscs and echinoderms. In this study, we extend these studies to Holothuria scabra, a sea cucumber species that is widely cultured for human consumption. In silico analysis of H. scabra neural and gonadal transcriptomes enabled the identification of 28 transcripts that encode a total of 26 bilaterian and echinoderm-specific neuropeptide precursors. Furthermore, publicly available sequence data from another sea cucumber, Holothuria glaberrima, allowed a more in-depth comparative investigation. Interestingly, two isoforms of a calcitonin-type peptide precursor (CTPP) were deduced from the H. scabra transcriptome – HscCTPP-long and HscCTPP-short, likely the result of alternative splicing. We also identified a sea cucumber relaxin-type peptide precursor, which is of interest because relaxin-type peptides have been shown to act as gonadotropic hormones in starfish. Two neuropeptides that appear to be holothurian-specific are GLRFA, and GN-19. In H. scabra, the expression of GLRFA was restricted to neural tissues, while GN-19 expression was additionally found in the longitudinal muscle and intestinal tissues. In conclusion, we have obtained new insights into the neuropeptide signaling systems of holothurians, which will facilitate physiological studies that may enable advances in the aquaculture of sea cucumbers. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Echinoderm; Gonads; Holothuria scabra; Nervous tissue; Neuropeptides; Transcriptomes,calcitonin; glrfa neuropeptide; gn 19 neuropeptide; gonadotropin; neuropeptide; protein precursor; transcriptome; unclassified drug; Article; Bilateria; comparative study; echinoderm; Holothuroidea; intestine tissue; muscle; nervous tissue; nonhuman; peptide analysis; priority journal; protein expression; protein splicing; sea cucumber; sequence analysis; transcriptomics,Article

Under today's fast-changing market and economic conditions, organizations have to effectively adjust themselves as the changes of internal and external environment always impact an organization's strategies and roadmaps. There is a clear interest from the management to know whether their roadmaps are still valid to the changing situations or whether there is a need to adjust their roadmaps. Therefore, it is important to assess the impacts of changes on the status of a roadmap which will indicate whether a roadmap needs to be slightly adjusted, totally revised, or just kept it unchanged. The management would also like to take proactive actions in monitoring the status of a roadmap and calling for an immediate action to review or revise a roadmap as major changes affect rather than waiting for the next periodical review schedule.

Materials and Methods: The present study was a cross-sectional descriptive study. A self-reported questionnaire was developed by the authors and sent via mail to all child and adolescent psychiatrists in Thailand. Chi-square test and ANOVA were used for categorical data and continuous data, respectively, to compare the variables between graduates from four training centers. Only data from respondents who graduated within the past 10 years were analyzed. Results: Of 95 respondents (54.0% response rate), 60 respondents finished child and adolescent psychiatry training within the past 10 years. Their average age was 33.6±3.6 years. Forty-nine (81.7%) of the respondents were female. Duration of child and adolescent psychiatry practice was 3.6±2.4 years. Twenty-one (35.0%), 19 (31.7%), 18 (30.0%), and two (3.3%) respondents graduated from the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, and Yuwaprasart Waithayopathum Hospital, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in the frequency of performing Satir Transformational Systemic Therapy [STST] and positive psychology by respondents who graduated from different training centers (p<0.001 and 0.02, respectively). Additionally, there were statistically significant differences in the levels of confidence in performing CBT, STST, Buddhist psychology, Mindfulness-based psychotherapy, and family therapy. Most respondents perceived that psychotherapy training received during residency was inadequate (86.7%), primarily due to inadequate training continuity (70.7%) and inconsistent supervision (65.5%). Conclusion: Psychotherapy training during residency had an important role in influencing the types of psychotherapy practiced post-graduation. The training experiences also had a significant bearing on future confidence in performing psychotherapy. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

We demonstrated the in situ synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) in a silk sericin (SS) matrix, using ascorbic acid as both a reducing agent and antioxidant. Development and optimization was achieved using a central composite design (CCD) in conjunction with the response surface methodology (RSM). The goal was to identify the concentrations of CuSO4 and SS that produced the optimal balance between UV protection and antibacterial activity, when tested against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The SS-CuNP bio-nanocomposites were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Statistical analyses indicated that an empirical second-order polynomial could accurately describe the UV protective factor, % reduction of S. aureus and % reduction of E. coli. The three-dimensional response surface graphs showed that the optimal concentrations of CuSO4 and SS were 2380 and 9500 ppm, respectively. To confirm that the levels identified using RSM were optimal in practice, performance evaluations were conducted. These investigated the durability and stability of UV protection and antibacterial activity after repeated washing cycles.

Interestingly, all indole derivatives inhibited the aromatase with IC50 range of 0.7–15.3 μM. Indoles (27–36) exerted higher aromatase inhibitory activity than that of ketoconazole. The phenoxy analogs 28 and 34 with methoxy group were shown to be the most potent compounds with sub-micromolar IC50 values (i.e., 0.7 and 0.8 μM, respectively) without affecting to the normal cell line. Molecular docking demonstrated that the indoles 28, 30 and 34 could occupy the same binding site on the aromatase pocket and share several binding residues with those of the natural substrate (androstenedione), which suggested the competitive binding could be the mode of inhibition of the compounds.

Relatively little is known regarding markers of virulence capable of identifying strains responsible for severe malaria. We investigated the effects of genetic variations in the P.f. merozoite surface protein 2 gene (msp2) on virulence, as it was previously postulated as a factor. We analyzed 300 msp2 sequences of single P. falciparum clone infection from patients with uncomplicated disease as well as those admitted for severe malaria with and without cerebral disease. The association of msp2 variations with disease severity was examined. We found that the N allele at codon 8 of Block 2 in the FC27-like msp2 gene was significantly associated with severe disease without cerebral complications (odds ratio = 2.73, P = 0.039), while the K allele at codon 17 of Block 4 in the 3D7-like msp2 gene was associated with cerebral malaria (odds ratio = 3.52, P = 0.024). The data suggests possible roles for the associated alleles on parasite invasion processes and immune-mediated pathogenicity. Multiplicity of infection was found to associate with severe disease without cerebral complications, but not cerebral malaria. Variations in the msp2-FC27-block 2-8N and 3D7-block 4-17K allele appear to be parasite virulence markers, and may be useful in determining the likelihood for severe and cerebral malaria. Their interactions with potential host factors for severe diseases should also be explored.

The kernel density estimate of area use for agriculture was 0.32 km2, and for mixed deciduous forest the estimate was 10.75 km2 and 6.2 km2 in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. When the wet and dry seasons are combined, the total area use for agriculture was 0.35 km2 and for mixed deciduous forest, it was 11.40 km2. Twenty-three forage species were identified using a combination of fecal analysis and direct observation. Fecal specimens contained high levels of moisture and protein.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the species identification criteria for Argyreia, especially new sources for taxonomically informative characters. Ten accessions representing three morphologically similar Argyreia operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were collected and their anatomical characters were investigated using the leaf peeling technique and paraffin sectioning method. Anatomical character states were analyzed using two phenetic analysis methods: clustering analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Three distinct clusters were clearly separated in both PCA and CA at the internal similarity coefficient of 0.48 with a high R-value of 0.89757. Nineteen effectively distinguishable character states were derived from the high loadings of the first two components. In conclusion, two of the separated groups were matched with known species, and the third separated group is here delineated as a new species.

Thus, one possible control strategy for shrimp Vibriosis is biofilm inhibition. With this objective, an extract from the Japanese fermented soybean product, Natto was tested with the luminescent shrimp pathogen Vibrio harveyi (VH) for its ability to inhibit or degrade biofilm and to interfere with cell growth in broth. Natto is a traditional fermentation product of Bacillus subtilis var Natto (BSN1). Using 96 well microtiter plates coated with 0.4% chitosan, we found that biofilm formation by VH was inhibited, while growth in parallel broth cultures was not. When an extract from Natto prepared using BSN1 was mixed with feed for the whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei before immersion challenge with V. harveyi at 106 cfu/ml, survival was significantly higher (p≤0.05) than for control shrimp given feed without these additives. Further work done to test whether D-amino acids were involved in biofilm formation as previously reported for B. subtilis, Staphylococus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa gave negative results. In conclusion, we discovered that Natto extract can inhibit Vibrio biofilm formation and that it or BSN1 alone added to shrimp feed can significantly reduce shrimp mortality in immersion challenges with pathogenic VH. This shows some promise for possible application against Vibriosis in shrimp since Natto is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) for human consumption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bacillus subtilis; Biofilm; Natto; Shrimp; Vibrio harveyi; Vibriosis,agar; antibiotic agent; chitosan; dextro amino acid; RNA 16S; soybean extract; amplicon; antibacterial activity; Article; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial growth; bacterium isolate; biofilm; biomass; cell growth; controlled study; fermented soybean; histopathology; mortality; nonhuman; Penaeus; Penaeus vannamei; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; survival; Vibrio harveyi; vibriosis,Article

As a result, game characteristics have been applied to education and training, where they are known as serious games. There is an increase in the volume of literature on serious games in healthcare education; however, evidence on their impact is still ambiguous. Aims: The aims of this study were (i) to identify high-quality evidence (systematic reviews or meta-analyses) regarding impacts of serious games on healthcare education; and (ii) to explore evidence regarding impacts of serious games in dental education. Methods: A rapid review of the literature was undertaken to synthesise available evidence and examine serious games in healthcare education (Stage 1) and dental education (Stage 2). Results: Nine systematic reviews were included in Stage 1, four of which were of high, three of moderate and two of low quality. For Stage 2, two randomised control trials with moderate quality were included. The findings demonstrated that serious games are potentially effective learning tools in terms of knowledge and skills improvement, although outcomes of serious games over traditional learning approaches were not consistent. In addition, serious games appeared to be more engaging and satisfying for students, which could be considered as the most important positive impact. Conclusion: Serious games provide an option for healthcare and dental education but remain underutilised and researched. At best, they offer a similar experience to other methods in relation to educational outcome; however, they can provide a supplementary strategy to engage students and improve learner satisfaction. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Dental education; Educational games; Health education; Healthcare education; Rapid review; Serious games,article; dental education; health education; human; human experiment; learning; meta analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); satisfaction; skill; student; systematic review,Article in Press

In addition to causing significant cassava yield loss, CBB disease has not been extensively studied, especially in terms of CBB resistance genes. The present research demonstrated the molecular mechanisms underlining the defense response during Xam infection in two cassava cultivars exhibiting different degrees of disease resistance, Huay Bong60 (HB60) and Hanatee (HN). Based on gene expression analysis, ten of twelve putative defense-related genes including, leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), resistance (R), WRKY and pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, were differentially expressed between these two cassava cultivars during Xam infection. The up-regulation of defense-related genes observed in HB60 may be the mechanism required for the reduction of disease severity in the resistant cultivar. Interestingly, priming with salicylic acid (SA) or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) for 24 h before Xam inoculation could enhance the defense response in both cassava cultivars. The disease severity was decreased 10% in the resistant cultivar (HB60) and was remarkably reduced 21% in the susceptible cultivar (HN) by SA/MeJA priming. Priming with Xam inoculation modulated cassava4.1_013417, cassava4.1_030866 and cassava4.1_020555 (highest similarity to MeWRKY59, MePR1 and AtPDF2.2, respectively) expression and led to enhanced resistance of the susceptible cultivar in the second infection. The putative cis-regulatory elements were predicted in an upstream region of these three defense-related genes. The different gene expression levels in these genes between the two cultivars were due to the differences in cis-regulatory elements in their promoter regions. Taken together, our study strongly suggested that the induction of defense-related genes correlated with defense resistance against Xam infection, and exogenous application of SA or MeJA could elevate the defense response in both cultivars of cassava. This finding should pave the way for management to reduce yield loss from disease and genetic improvement in cassava. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",Cassava; Cassava bacterial blight disease; Defense response; Jasmonic acid; Priming with phytohormone; Salicylic acid; Xanthomonas axonopodis,"phytochrome; disease resistance; drug effects; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; growth, development and aging; Manihot; metabolism; microbiology; plant disease; Xanthomonas axonopodis; Disease Resistance; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Manihot; Phytochrome; Plant Diseases; Transcription, Genetic; Xanthomonas axonopodis",Article

First, the production of hydrogen from a co-digestion of grass with cow dung and silage with cow dung by Clostridium butyricum Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR) 1032 was conducted. The results indicated that bio-hydrogen production by C. butyricum TISTR 1032 gave a higher hydrogen yield (HY) than without C. butyricum addition. The HY of 6.98 and 27.71 mL H2/g-Volatile solidadded (VSadded), were obtained from a co-digestion of grass with cow dung and silage with cow dung by C. butyricum, respectively. The hydrogenic effluent and solid residue left over after hydrogen fermentation were further used as substrates for methane production (Batch I). Methane yield (MY) from hydrogenic effluent of grass with cow dung and silage with cow dung were 169.87 and 141.33 mL CH4/g-CODadded (COD: chemical oxygen demand), respectively. The maximum MY of 210.10 and 177.79 mL CH4/g-VSadded, respectively, were attained from solid residues left over after bio-hydrogen production pretreated by enzyme (cellulase cocktail) and alkali (NaOH). Afterward, solid residue left over after methane production (Batch I) was used as the substrate for methane production (Batch II). A maximum MY of 370.39 and 370.99 mL CH4/g-VSadded were achieved from solid residue repeatedly pretreated by alkaline plus enzyme, respectively. The overall energy yield in the two-stage bio-hydrogen and methane production process was derived from a bio-hydrogen production, a methane production from hydrogenic effluent, methane production of pretreated solid residue (Batch I) and methane production of repeatedly pretreated solid residue (Batch II), which yielded 480.27 and 204.70 MJ/g-VSadded, respectively. © 2017 by the authors.",Biogas; Biomass; Biorefinery; Energy crop; Renewable energy,Alkalinity; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Biomass; Chemical oxygen demand; Crops; Enzymes; Methane; Sodium compounds; Substrates; Thallium compounds; Bio-hydrogen production; Biorefineries; Clostridium butyricum; Energy crops; Production of hydrogen; Renewable energies; Technological researches; Two-stage anaerobic digestions; Hydrogen production,Article

However, the relation between taste perception and food culture is unclear. This study compared taste thresholds between populations with different food culture, i.e. Thai and Japanese. A matched case-control study was conducted in 168 adults (84 for each; aged between 50 and 90 years). The age, sex, systemic disease, medication, smoking, xerostomia, and oral hygiene of both groups were not different. Recognition thresholds (RTs) of sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami were measured using filter paper disc (FPD). Detection taste thresholds were measured using electrogustometry. Spicy preference was measured by calibrated questionnaires. Higher RTs of all tastes and higher detection taste thresholds were found in Thai as compared to those of Japanese (P < 0.0001). Separate analyses of healthy and unhealthy persons confirmed the significant differences between 2 countries. The average thresholds for sweet, salty, sour, and bitter in Thai and Japanese were 4 and 2, respectively. The average threshold for umami in Thai and Japanese was 5 and 3, respectively. Moreover, Thai population had stronger preference for spicy food (P < 0.0001) with 70% mild- or moderate and 10% strong lovers, compared to over 90% non- or mild-spicy lovers in Japanese. In addition, 70% of Thai consumed spicy food weekly, whilst 80% of Japanese consumed it monthly. Our findings suggested that population with stronger spicy preference such as Thai had much poorer taste sensitivity and perception than that with milder preference like Japanese. Extensive international survey is needed to conclude the influence of food culture on taste perception. © The Author(s) 2017.",Cross-culture; Electrogustometer threshold; Older persons; Spicy preference; Taste recognition threshold; Umami,glutamate sodium; quinine; sodium chloride; sucrose; tartaric acid; adult; aged; Article; bitter taste; controlled study; cultural factor; female; flavor; human; human experiment; Japanese (people); male; mouth hygiene; priority journal; saltiness; smoking; sour taste; spicy; sweetness; taste acuity; taste discrimination; taste preference; Thai (people); umami,Article

We recently identified phthoxazolin A as a cryptic metabolite of Streptomyces avermitilis that produces the important anthelmintic agent avermectin. Even though genome data of S. avermitilis is publicly available, no plausible biosynthetic gene cluster for phthoxazolin A is apparent in the sequence data. Here, we identified and characterized the phthoxazolin A (ptx) biosynthetic gene cluster through genome sequencing, comparative genomic analysis, and gene disruption. Sequence analysis uncovered that the putative ptx biosynthetic genes are laid on an extra genomic region that is not found in the public database, and 8 open reading frames in the extra genomic region could be assigned roles in the biosynthesis of the oxazole ring, triene polyketide and carbamoyl moieties. Disruption of the ptxA gene encoding a discrete acyltransferase resulted in a complete loss of phthoxazolin A production, confirming that the trans-AT type I PKS system is responsible for the phthoxazolin A biosynthesis. Based on the predicted functional domains in the ptx assembly line, we propose the biosynthetic pathway of phthoxazolin A. © 2018 Suroto et al.

Tracking of the ICR in LBP patients has not been systematically investigated. This study aimed to (1) determine the within-session measurement error of ICR parameters, and (2) characterize the change in ICR among three groups of participants (no history of LBP = HC; history of LBP = HLBP; and current LBP = LBP). Methods: Ninety-three participants (HC = 31; HLBP = 33; and LBP = 29) were recruited. Participants performed two sets of three repetitions of an active forward bend, while their lumbar and pelvic movements were recorded with an electromagnetic tracking system. Total ICR displacement and the radius of the bounding sphere containing the ICR were derived during the forward bending and the return to upright phases. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC3,3) and minimal detectable difference (MDD) were used to determine measurement error and interpret findings of the group analysis. One-way ANOVAs and post hoc Bonferroni comparisons were used to determine differences among groups. Results: ICC3,3 demonstrated excellent within-session test–retest reliability of the ICR parameters (ICC3,3 = 0.86–0.97). The MDD values were 0.20–3.40 mm. Comparisons between the HC and LBP groups and between the HLBP and LBP groups showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) for all ICR parameters, with medium effect sizes (0.51–0.66), except for total displacement during forward bending between the HC and LBP groups. Conclusion: Less ICR displacement and variability in patients with LBP may indicate coping strategies to stiffen the lumbar spine. This could result from patients with LBP adopting a strategy of increased muscle activation to provide spinal stability during functional tasks. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Aberrant movement; Center of rotation; Kinematics; Non-specific low back pain,adult; aged; Article; female; human; instantaneous center of rotation; low back pain; male; measurement error; movement (physiology); neuromuscular function; priority journal; range of motion; standing; test retest reliability,Article

Aims: To review the literature concerning the costing analysis situation of MDR-TB treatment. Methods: The study was conducted as a systematic review, with a modified checklist being used as the vital instrument. A search was performed of three databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus) using the terms (cost OR economic, socioeconomic, expenditure, burden, fee, charge, budget impact) AND (resistance OR multidrug resistance, MDR) AND (tuberculosis OR TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) in order to identify relevant articles published from 2006 to the present. Results: A total of 1238 abstracts were identified, and 12 papers were ultimately included in the study. The quantity of the published articles was found to increase during in the period 2008 to 2016. Almost all the studies were based on patients’ and healthcare systems’ perceptions. The main data sources used were medical establishments and the reports of various relevant organizations. Primary data were used twice as much as secondary data. All the costing types, including direct costs and indirect costs, were mentioned, albeit not with the same frequency. Conclusions: Africa owns one third of the articles included. Further, it was found that MDR-TB should be treated using ambulatory care rather than hospital-based models. Future research studies should focus on Asia, where drug resistance has proved to be a challenging issue. © 2018 Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacognosy Research.",Cost; Literature review; Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; Systematic review; Tuberculosis,health belief; health care cost; health care organization; health care system; health personnel attitude; human; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; patient attitude; Review; systematic review,Review

Obligate intracellular bacteria replicate exclusively within the interior of living cells, an osmotically protected niche. Under these conditions peptidoglycan is not necessarily needed to maintain the integrity of the bacterial cell. Moreover, the presence of peptidoglycan puts bacteria at risk of detection and destruction by host peptidoglycan recognition factors and downstream effectors. This has resulted in a selective pressure and opportunity to reduce the levels of peptidoglycan. In this review we have analysed the occurrence of genes involved in peptidoglycan metabolism across the major obligate intracellular bacterial species. From this comparative analysis, we have identified a group of predicted ‘peptidoglycan-intermediate’ organisms that includes the Chlamydiae, Orientia tsutsugamushi, Wolbachia and Anaplasma marginale. This grouping is likely to reflect biological differences in their infection cycle compared with peptidoglycan-negative obligate intracellular bacteria such as Ehrlichia and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, as well as obligate intracellular bacteria with classical peptidoglycan such as Coxiella, Buchnera and members of the Rickettsia genus.

Purification of γδ T cells is needed for insight when studying their anti-cancer functionality and their utilization in adoptive cell therapy. To improve the purification of γδ T cells, in this work, a composite material based on magnetic nanoparticles was developed for purification of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, the predominant subset of γδ T lymphocytes in human peripheral blood. The epoxy-functionalized magnetic poly(divinylbenzene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) particles (mPDGs) were bio-conjugated with anti-human Vδ2 antibody to provide specific recognition sites for T cell receptors of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, separation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors was confirmed with high purity [89.77% (range 87.00-91.80, n = 3)]. More interestingly, the immobilized particles did not affect the viability of purified cells as high cell viability was indicated (>90%). By combining the properties of magnetic nanoparticles with specific antibodies, these immobilized particles were shown to be used as a cell-friendly purification tool of Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes without any limits for the further use of cells. The purified Vγ9Vδ2 T cells using the antibody-immobilized epoxy-functionalized mPDGs could be used directly without a detachment step for further cultivation and expansion. This highlights the advantages of this method in allowing the study of cell function and further investigation of such rare T cell populations in immunotherapy. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Acrylic monomers; Antibodies; Blood; Cell culture; Cell membranes; Cell proliferation; Diseases; Flow cytometry; Magnetic bubbles; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Purification; Cell populations; Colloidal particle; Fluorescence activated cell sorting; Glycidyl methacrylate; Human peripheral blood; Magnetic nano-particles; Peripheral blood mononuclear cells; Specific recognition; T-cells,Article

To evaluate the pattern of ischemia, we compared peripapillary capillary density (PCD) in NAION eyes to POAG eyes matched for visual field mean deviation and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Methods 31 chronic NAION (>6 months after the acute event) and unaffected fellow eyes (31 subjects), 42 moderate and severe POAG eyes (27 subjects), and 77 control eyes (46 healthy subjects) were imaged with a commercial optical coherence tomography angiography system (AngioVue, Avanti RTVue-XR, Optovue, CA) at two academic institutions. Two concentric circles of diameters 1.95mm (inner) and 3.45mm (outer) were manually placed on images centered on the optic nerve head, producing an annular region-of-interest. Image analysis with major vessel removal was performed using a custom program. Whole-image, whole-annulus, and sectoral PCDs were measured. Results Whole-image and whole-annulus PCDs in NAION and moderate and severe POAG eyes were significantly decreased compared to unaffected fellow eyes and control eyes (all P<0.001). Superior and temporal PCD values were affected more than other sectors in both NAION and POAG groups compared to control group. Whole-image and whole-annulus PCDs were not statistically different between NAION and POAG eyes (both P = 0.99). However, of all peripapillary sectors, the inferior sector PCD value was less affected in POAG eyes compared to NAION eyes (P = 0.001). Univariate analysis results also revealed a significant positive correlation between superior and inferior PCDs and corresponding RNFL thicknesses. The inferior sector correlation was greater in POAG than NAION eyes. Conclusion While the whole PCD values were not different in chronic NAION and POAG, the greater correlation of inferior PCD with corresponding RNFL sectors in POAG compared to NAION suggests greater susceptibility of the inferior radial peripapillary capillary in the pathogenesis of POAG. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

As a result of information exchanging, and as the data in question is sensitive, watermark embedding is then used in the medical image processing in order to prevent the digital content from being modified without permission as well as to verify the authenticity of medical images. In this paper, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based image watermarking method are used to hide patient’s data into the Region of Interest (ROI) to show the identity and to verify the data authenticity. The contents of ROI is important for diagnostic decision making. Thus, in this paper, the researchers give priority to the imperceptibility performance. Patient’s data will be taken to create a Quick Response (QR) code before embedding watermarks in order to increase the security level of data and the data capacity. The experiment’s results reveal that imperceptibility performance can be achieved. This watermark embedding approach is high in the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values and robust from various attacks. The extracted watermark can be decoded back into text information although it was attacked. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Digital watermarking; Discrete wavelet transform; Medical image; Quick response code; Region of interest; Telemedicine,Authentication; Codes (symbols); Decision making; Diagnosis; Digital watermarking; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image compression; Image segmentation; Image watermarking; Medical imaging; Natural language processing systems; Signal to noise ratio; Telemedicine; Diagnostic decision makings; Embedding watermarks; Image authentication; Information exchanging; Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR); Quick response code; Region of interest; The region of interest (ROI); Signal reconstruction,Conference Paper

Considering spiking population and carbon emission trends, especially in metropolitan cities of developing countries, such estimations are direly needed. Moreover, quantification and empirical evidence involving such a multidisciplinary analysis are rarely available. Therefore, this study would help in understanding the relationship among economic development, carbon emissions, carbon sinks and land use change in BMA. CO2 emission and sequestration data from 1987 to 2015 were collected, and the changes and rate of change in LCLU were assessed by analyzing landsat satellite images of 1987, 1995, 2005, and 2015. Best efforts were put to attain net gains and losses in carbon sources and sinks analyses. Results showed that carbon sources have increased by almost 4-folds from 1987 to 2015 while sinks have declined rapidly to half of its original amount since 1987. The gap between carbon sources and sinks is widening year by year and will, if it continues in this manner, cover up the whole green space of BMA in the next decade. The LCLU change results also verified and showed the same results, which helped in validating such outcomes. Urban/built up area sprawl over 60% of BMA's area while the remaining 40% constitutes agricultural land, green spaces, and water bodies. Furthermore, the rate of change of urban area was 157.4 sq km during 2005–2015 and 218 sq km during 1995–2005. Therefore, policy makers of BMA should seriously draft expansion plans of green spaces and public parks and implement it immediately to tackle with carbon emissions and land use change disquiets. Meanwhile, awareness regarding conservation of green areas, trees, and use of public transport could be another set of bottom-up policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",ArcGIS; Carbon emissions; Carbon sinks; Green growth; Land cover/land use; Remote sensing; Sustainability,carbon emission; carbon sink; GIS; green economy; land cover; land use change; metropolitan area; remote sensing; sustainability; valuation; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand,Article

The HLA-B alleles associated with carbamazepine-induced maculopapular exanthema (MPE) and the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) among the Thai population have never been reported. The aim of the present study was to carry out an analysis of the involvement of HLA-B alleles in carbamazepine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) in the Thai population. A case-control study was performed by genotyping the HLA-B alleles of Thai carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reaction patients (17 MPE, 16 SJS/TEN, and 5 DRESS) and 271 carbamazepine-tolerant controls. We also recruited 470 healthy Thai candidate subjects who had not taken carbamazepine. HLA-B∗15:02 showed a significant association with carbamazepine-induced MPE (P=0.0022, odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 7.27 (2.04-25.97)) and carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN (P=4.46×10-13; OR (95% CI) = 70.91(19.67-255.65)) when compared with carbamazepine-tolerant controls. Carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN also showed an association with HLA-B∗15:21 allele (P=0.013; OR (95% CI) = 9.54 (1.61-56.57)) when compared with carbamazepine-tolerant controls. HLA-B∗58:01 allele was significantly related to carbamazepine-induced MPE (P=0.007; OR (95% CI) = 4.73 (1.53-14.66)) and DRESS (P=0.0315; OR (95% CI) = 7.55 (1.20-47.58)) when compared with carbamazepine-tolerant controls.

Sitafloxacin (STFX) is a new fluoroquinolone with in vitro activity against a broad range of bacteria, including M. tuberculosis. This study aimed to determine the in vitro activity of STFX against all groups of drug-resistant strains, including multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR M. tuberculosis), MDR M. tuberculosis with quinolone resistance (pre-XDR), and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. A total of 374 drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains were tested for drug susceptibility by the conventional proportion method, and 95 strains were randomly submitted for MIC determination using the microplate alamarBlue assay (MABA). The results revealed that all the drug-resistant strains were susceptible to STFX at a critical concentration of 2 g/ml. Determination of the MIC90s of the strains showed different MIC levels; MDR M. tuberculosis strains had a MIC90 of 0.0625 g/ml, whereas pre-XDR and XDR M. tuberculosis strains had identical MIC90s of 0.5 g/ml. Common mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA and/or gyrB did not confer resistance to STFX, except that double mutations of GyrA at Ala90Val and Asp94Ala were found in strains with a MIC of 1.0 g/ml. The results indicated that STFX had potent in vitro activity against all the groups of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains and should be considered a new repurposed drug for treatment of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB.

However, data on bullous pemphigoid, one of the most common autoimmune blistering disorders, is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to summarize all available evidence. Methods: Two investigators independently searched published studies indexed in MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to July 2016 using the terms for bullous pemphigoid and venous thromboembolism. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) cohort or case-control study evaluated the association between bullous pemphigoid and risk of venous thromboembolism, (2) effect estimates were provided as odds ratios, relative risk, hazard ratio, standardized incidence ratio with 95% confidence intervals, and (3) subjects without bullous pemphigoid were used as comparators for cohort studies, while subjects without venous thromboembolism were used as comparators for case-control studies. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals were extracted from each study and were pooled together using the random-effect model, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic were used to evaluate the statistical heterogeneity. Results: Two retrospective cohort studies, one prospective cohort study, and one case-control study met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio was 2.69 (95% confidence interval, 1.79-4.05). Statistical heterogeneity was high with I2 of 77%. Limitation: Limited accuracy of diagnosis of primary studies and high between-study heterogeneity. Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with bullous pemphigoid have a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism. copy; 2017 Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology.",Bullous; meta-analysis as topic; pemphigoid; venous thromboembolism,Article; autoimmune disease; blood pressure; bullous pemphigoid; clinical practice; erythema; human; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; venous thromboembolism,Article

However, conventional anaerobic cultivation methods require 1-2 days of incubation. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we developed a DNA-based method to simultaneously detect representative bacteriophages (B40-8 and B56-3) that infect B. fragilis strains HSP40 and RYC2056, respectively. Both phages yielded a 224-bp amplicon with the primer pair BT5414/BT5415, and an additional 152-bp PCR product was observed for B40-8 with the primer pair BT5579/BT5580. The detection limits for B40-8 and B56-3 were 10-5 and 10-4 ng of pure DNA, and 1 and 50 ng of DNA template when 5 and 5,000 PFU/mL were spiked into distilled water, respectively. The assay exhibited a higher sensitivity for sewage samples, with &lt; 0.1 and 15 PFU/mL of phages infecting HSP40 and RYC2056, respectively. The assay did not produce false positive results for the Bacteroides phages PG76, HB13, and GA17 or for the enterococcal phages AIM06 and SR14. The assay also detected RYC2056 phages that were isolated from sewage samples and the phage B40-8 when it was spiked into raw sewage. Thus, the newly developed PCR assay demonstrated potential for the environmental monitoring of Bacteroides bacteriophages, decreasing the analysis time to a few hours. © 2018, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University.

Homodimerization and heterodimerization of the HER family are important for activation of these receptors. The structures of homodimer conformation are well characterized, while the structures of heterodimer conformations, especially between HER1 and HER2, are not completely understood. In this study, two models of possible asymmetric HER1/HER2 kinase domains were built. Molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methods were applied to examine the possibility of these two-heterodimer interactions. From our results, it could be concluded that the HER2 kinase domain prefers to serve as the receiver rather than the activator. Key binding residues of this dimer complex at N lobe of HER2 is ALA683 and at C lobe of HER1 are GLU914, GLU917, and ASP930.

The earliest enucleated forms derived in this process, known as reticulocytes, are multi-lobular and spherical. As reticulocytes mature, they undergo a series of dynamic cytoskeletal re-arrangements and the expulsion of residual organelles, resulting in highly deformable biconcave RBCs (normocytes). To understand the significant, yet neglected proteome-wide changes associated with reticulocyte maturation, we undertook a quantitative proteomics approach. Immature reticulocytes (marked by the presence of surface transferrin receptor, CD71) and mature RBCs (devoid of CD71) were isolated from human cord blood using a magnetic separation procedure. After sub-fractionation into triton-extracted membrane proteins and luminal samples (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation), quantitative mass spectrometry was conducted to identify more than 1800 proteins with good confidence and coverage. While most structural proteins (such as Spectrins, Ankyrin and Band 3) as well as surface glycoproteins were conserved, proteins associated with microtubule structures, such as Talin-1/2 and ß-Tubulin, were detected only in immature reticulocytes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based imaging revealed an extended network of spectrin filaments in reticulocytes (with an average length of 48 nm), which shortened during reticulocyte maturation (average spectrin length of 41 nm in normocytes). The extended nature of cytoskeletal network may partly account for increased deformability and shape changes, as reticulocytes transform to normocytes. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",cytoskeleton; iTRAQ; quantitative proteomics; red blood cells; reticulocytes,"ankyrin; beta tubulin; CD71 antigen; erythrocyte band 3 protein; glycoprotein; proteome; spectrin; talin; talin 1 protein; talin 2 protein; unclassified drug; biological marker; proteome; Article; atomic force microscopy; cell maturation; cell size; cell structure; cell subpopulation; controlled study; cytoskeleton; discocyte; erythrocyte; human; human cell; mass spectrometry; microtubule; molecular imaging; priority journal; protein determination; protein modification; proteomics; quantitative analysis; reticulocyte; umbilical cord blood; biology; cell differentiation; cytology; fetus blood; gene ontology; hematopoiesis; high performance liquid chromatography; immunomagnetic separation; immunophenotyping; mass spectrometry; metabolism; procedures; reticulocyte; Biomarkers; Cell Differentiation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Computational Biology; Fetal Blood; Gene Ontology; Hematopoiesis; Humans; Immunomagnetic Separation; Immunophenotyping; Mass Spectrometry; Proteome; Proteomics; Reticulocytes",Article

As part of a clinical trial in western Cambodia, four villages receivedMDAin 2015-2016. Before approaching study communities, a collaboration was established with the local health authorities, village leaders, and village malaria workers. Formative research guided the development of engagement strategies. In each village, a team of volunteers was formed to explain MDA to their neighbors and provide support during implementation. Public mobilization events featuring drama and music were used to introduce MDA. Villages comprised groups with different levels of understanding and interests; therefore, multiple tailored engagement strategies were required. The main challenges were explaining malaria transmission, managing perceptions of drug side effects, and reaching mobile populations. It was important that local leaders took a central role in community engagement. Coverage during each round of MDA averaged 84%, which met the target for the trial. © 2018 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",,antimalarial agent; artemisinin; dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine; adverse outcome; Article; asymptomatic infection; Cambodia; common cold symptom; community care; dizziness; fatigue; health care planning; human; infection risk; malaria; malaria falciparum; mass drug administration; nonhuman; outcome assessment; parasite prevalence; public health message; public health service; social participation,Article

This study determined the contents of phytochemicals including oryzanols, phytosterols, tocopherols (Toc) and tocotrienols (T3) in RBOs extracted using different methods namely cold-press extraction (CPE), solvent extraction (SE) and supercritical CO2 extraction (SC-CO2). Two colored rice, Red Jasmine rice (RJM, red rice) and Hom-nin rice (HN, black rice), were studied in comparison with the popular Thai fragrant rice Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105, white rice). RBOs were found to be the rich source of oryzanols, phytosterols, Toc and T3. Rice varieties had a greater effect on the phytochemicals concentrations than extraction methods. HN rice showed the significantly highest concentration of all phytochemicals, followed by RJM and KDML 105 rice, indicating that colored rice contained high concentration of phytochemicals in the oil than non-colored rice.

Method: A total of 256 patients fulfilling criteria for RA and starting bDMARD between December 2009 and October 2014 were selected from the Rheumatic Disease Prior Authorization registry. Baseline demographic and clinical data were recorded. The cumulative probability of bDMARD discontinuation over 5 years of follow-up and factors associated with RA remission and bDMARD withdrawal were analyzed. Results: Almost half (46%) of patients were initially treated with rituximab (RTX), with 33% treated with etanercept (ETN) and 21% with infliximab (IFX). Fewer than 10% were subsequently switched to a second bDMARD. The 1- and 5-year remission rates in patients continuing their first bDMARD were 7.2% and 21.5%, respectively. At 5 years, the drug survival rates for RTX, ETN and IFX were 50%, 25% and 22%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that RTX was significantly associated with highest drug survival. Relative to RTX, the hazard ratios for discontinuation of IFX and ETN were 2.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53–4.42) and 2.15 (95% CI 1.36–3.42), respectively. Thirty-nine percent of patients stopped treatments, due to inadequate response (42%), serious adverse events (22%), nonadherence (14%) or remission/low disease activity (13%). Conclusion: Over 5 years, only one-third of patients continued using their first bDMARD. The leading cause of drug discontinuation was inadequate response. © 2016 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",biological DMARDs; drug survival; reason for discontinuation; rheumatoid arthritis,disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; infliximab; rituximab; adult; adverse outcome; Article; aspiration pneumonia; community acquired pneumonia; disease activity; disease association; disease registry; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug response; drug safety; drug withdrawal; female; follow up; heart infarction; hepatitis B; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mycobacteriosis; priority journal; remission; retention time; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; survival rate; Thai (people); treatment outcome,Article

Our objective was to engender synthetic lethality to paclitaxel (PTX), the frontline treatment for endometrial cancer, in tumours with mutant p53 and enhance the therapeutic efficacy using polymeric nanoparticles (NPs). First, we identified the optimal NP formulation through comprehensive analyses of release profiles and cellular-uptake and cell viability studies. Not only were PTX-loaded NPs superior to PTX in solution, but the combination of PTX-loaded NPs with the antiangiogenic molecular inhibitor BIBF 1120 (BIBF) promoted synthetic lethality specifically in cells with the loss-of-function (LOF) p53 mutation. In a xenograft model of endometrial cancer, this combinatorial therapy resulted in a marked inhibition of tumour progression and extended survival. Together, our data provide compelling evidence for future studies of BIBF- and PTX-loaded NPs as a therapeutic opportunity for LOF p53 cancers. © 2017 The Author(s).",,nanoparticle; nintedanib; paclitaxel; protein p53; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; bioaccumulation; cancer survival; cell killing; cell viability; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug release; drug safety; drug stability; endometrium cancer; female; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; mouse; nanopharmaceutics; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal,Article

Patients with H. pylori infection may be at an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) because of chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. Several epidemiologic studies attempting to determine this risk have yielded inconsistent results. This meta-analysis was conducted with the aims to summarize all available evidence and estimate the risk of NAFLD in patients with H. pylori infection. Methods: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE database from inception to June 2016. Studies that reported relative risks, odd ratios, or hazard ratios comparing the risk of NAFLD among patients with H. pylori infection versus without H. pylori infection were included. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. Results: Six studies met our eligibility criteria and were included in this analysis. We found a statistically significant increased risk of NAFLD among patients with H. pylori infection with the pooled odds ratios of 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.37). The statistical heterogeneity was low with an I 2 of 49%. Conclusions: A significantly increased risk of NAFLD among patients with H. pylori infection was demonstrated in this meta-analysis. Further studies are required to clarify how this risk should be addressed in clinical practice. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: 13 observers detected holes in a Teflon phantom in cone-beam CT images. Using the same images, we developed a new method, cluster signal-to-noise analysis, to detect the holes by applying various cut-off values using ImageJ and reconstructing cluster signal-tonoise curves. We then evaluated the correlation between cluster signal-to-noise analysis and the observer performance test. We measured the background noise in each image to evaluate the relationship with false positive rates (FPRs) of the observers. Correlations between mean FPRs and intra- and interobserver variations were also evaluated. Moreover, we calculated true positive rates (TPRs) and accuracies from background noise and evaluated their correlations with TPRs from observers. Results: Cluster signal-to-noise curves were derived in cluster signal-to-noise analysis. They yield the detection of signals (true holes) related to noise (false holes). This method correlated highly with the observer performance test (R2 = 0.9296). In noisy images, increasing background noise resulted in higher FPRs and larger intra- and interobserver variations. TPRs and accuracies calculated from background noise had high correlation with actual TPRs from observers; R2 was 0.9244 and 0.9338, respectively. Conclusions: Cluster signal-to-noise analysis can simulate the detection performance of observers and thus replace the observer performance test in the evaluation of image quality. Erroneous decision-making increased with increasing background noise. © 2018 The Authors.

To make a platinum-DNA adduct that causes less helical distortion than the cisplatin 1,2-intrastrand adduct, we designed and synthesized a monofunctional platinum-carbazole conjugate (carbazoplatin). The 2.5 Å crystal structure of carbazoplatin-DNA adduct revealed both the monoplatination of the N7 of a guanine (G) base and the intercalation into two G:C base pairs, while causing a minor distortion of the DNA helix. A 50-mer dsDNA containing a single carbazoplatin lesion was poorly processed by UvrABC endonuclease, the prokaryotic NER machinery that detects helical distortion and performs dual incision around the lesion.

Methods Post hoc analysis of patient-level data (Asian n = 235; non-Asian n = 3351) from 16 trials. Results At baseline, Asian patients were younger with lower body mass index (BMI), fasting C-peptide, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) than non-Asian patients (all P <.001). Asian patients had a higher mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 24 and less reduction in HbA1c from baseline (7.4% vs. 7.2%; −1.3% vs. −1.6%, respectively; P =.0001), and were less likely to achieve HbA1c <7.0% (40% vs. 47%; P =.002) than non-Asian patients. Reductions in FPG and rates of hypoglycaemia were similar between Asian and non-Asian patients. Asian patients had less weight gain than non-Asian patients (+1.3 vs. +1.9 kg, respectively, P =.013). Conclusions In our post hoc meta-analysis, Gla-100 effectively lowers HbA1c and FPG in Asian patients with T2D uncontrolled on OADs with similar incidence of hypoglycaemia and less absolute weight gain compared with non-Asian patients. At a similar FPG reduction, fewer Asian patients achieved HbA1c target <7.0%, suggesting that prandial glucose needs to be addressed. © 2017",Asian; Insulin glargine; Meta-analysis; Type 2 diabetes,"C peptide; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin glargine; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; sulfonylurea; antidiabetic agent; insulin glargine; Article; Asian; body mass; body weight; clinical outcome; comparative study; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; ethnicity; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; hypoglycemia; meta analysis; morbidity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient selection; post hoc analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); weight gain; analysis; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; controlled study; female; male; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; randomized controlled trial; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Glargine; Male; Middle Aged",Article

In this study, a haemocyanin gene of Macrobrachium rosenbergii, designated MrHc, was successfully isolated. The MrHc gene contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,992 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 663 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 76.5 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence contained distinct structural motifs of the haemocyanin superfamily, including an all-alpha domain, a copper-containing domain and an immunoglobulin-like domain. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the MrHC protein demonstrated a close relationship with the haemocyanins of Palaemon carinicauda and Macrobrachium nipponense. The MrHc gene was expressed in various shrimp tissues, including the hepatopancreas, gill, haemocytes, stomach and muscle. After Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) challenge tests, the MrHc gene was up-regulated 237-fold at day 2. A recombinant protein of the MrHc immunoglobulin-like domain exhibited antibacterial activity against Vibrio vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, Aeromonas caviae, A. veronii, A. hydrophila and Bacillus cereus. This study suggested that MrHc may play important roles in the shrimp innate immune response to MrNV infection and bacterial infection. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",antibacterial activity; haemocyanin; Macrobrachium rosenbergii; Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus,Aeromonas punctata; Bacillus cereus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Exopalaemon carinicauda; Macrobrachium nipponense; Macrobrachium rosenbergii; Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus; Vibrio vulnificus,Article

Objective: To examine incidents and contributing factors including corrective strategies of EI in the Perioperative and Anesthetic Adverse Events in Thailand [PAAd Thai] Study, hosted by the Royal College of Anesthesiologists of Thailand. Materials and Methods: A multi-center prospective observational study was conducted between January and December 2015. All EI incidents from the first 2,000 incident reports from 22 participating hospitals across Thailand were reported and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: One hundred sixty-nine EI incidents (8.45%) were reported from the first 2,000 incident reports in the PAAd Thai database. The incidence of delayed detection of EI was rare (0.28:10,000). Practice with trainees is a common situation (55.6%), however, most cases were early detection by clinical examination and/or capnometer without physiologic sequelae. Pediatric patients, cesarean section, and difficult intubation may lead to oxygen desaturation, with few cases of oxygen desaturation and bradycardia. Conclusion: While the EI incidence rates in Thailand remained constant, the incidence of delayed detection was dramatically reduced because of increased availability of end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring. Vigilance, additional training, and more equipment availability are recommended. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

A tree-ring δ13C chronology was constructed based on four cores covering the period of 1788–2013. After removing the long-term decreasing trend reflecting atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the ∆13C chronology was able to capture both temperature and hydro-climate signals. ∆13C chronology showed particularly strong and significant negative correlation (r = –0.62, p &lt; 0.0001) with June–September maximum temperature (CRU TS 3.24). The maximum temperature was reconstructed, which explained 37.8% of the variance in the instrumental maximum temperatures over the period of 1901–2013. The maximum temperature reconstruction revealed that four cooler and three warmer periods, as well as a slightly increasing temperature trend, occurred during the late seventeenth to mid-eighteenth centuries, which were followed by severe temperature fluctuations during the twentieth century century. While the sea surface temperature anomaly in the Indian Ocean might not affect the maximum temperature, its unstable relationship with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was detected. In addition, a close relationship was observed between the maximum temperature and ENSO during the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), but this relationship was lost during the positive phase of the PDO. © 2018 The Author(s).

Children who contract diarrheal diseases are rarely screened to identify the etiologic agent due to time and cost considerations associated with pathogen-specific screening and hence pathogen-directed therapy is uncommon. The development of biomarkers to rapidly identify underlying pathogens could improve treatment options and clinical outcomes in childhood diarrheal diseases. Here, we perform RNA sequencing on blood samples collected from children evaluated in an emergency room setting with diarrheal disease where the pathogen(s) present are known. We determine host response gene signatures specific to Salmonella, Shigella and rotavirus, but not E. coli, infections that distinguish them from each other and from healthy controls. Specifically, we observed differential expression of genes related to chemokine receptors or inflammasome signaling in Shigella cases, such as CCR3, CXCR8, and NLRC4, and interferon response genes, such as IFI44 and OASL, in rotavirus cases. Our findings add insight into the host peripheral immune response to these pathogens, and suggest strategies and limitations for the use host response transcript signatures for diagnosing the etiologic agent of childhood diarrheal diseases. © 2018 DeBerg et al.

The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii isolates collected from four tertiary hospitals in Thailand during the period November 2013-February 2015. We screened 339 A. baumannii, nonrepetitive clinical isolates to determine drug susceptibility. Among all isolates, we found that 7.9% was nondrug-resistant A. baumannii (NR-AB). Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CR-AB) strains accounted for 84.9% of the total isolates, with extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDR-AB) accounting for 7.9% of the total isolates. We further investigated class D carbapenemase genes using multiplex-PCR amplification and class B metallo-β-lactamase genes, including blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaNDM-1 genes, using PCR and sequencing methods. We found that 300 (88.5%) isolates carried acquired class D carbapenemase genes, including blaOXA-23 (82.6%), blaOXA-24 (0.3%), and blaOXA-58 (6.5%). The genes blaIMP and blaVIM were not detected in any isolates. The blaNDM-1 was detected in 31 isolates from two hospitals (9.1%). All of the blaNDM-1-positive A. baumannii (NDM-AB) had ISAba125 sequences upstream of the blaNDM-1 gene. A coexistence of three resistance genes-blaOXA-23-blaOXA-58-blaNDM-1-was found in one isolate. A repetitive element palindromic-PCR (REP-PCR) revealed that all A. baumannii isolates were genetically diverse and could be divided into 33 genotypes. Only three genotypes were found to be predominant in all hospitals. Data from our study indicate the widespread emergence of multiple resistance determinants in A. baumannii isolates in Thailand, suggesting the need for more stringent infection control measures. © 2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Acinetobacter baumannii; blaNDM-1 gene; blaOXA-23 gene; carbapenemase; metallo-b-lactamase,amikacin; carbapenemase; cefepime; cefoperazone plus sulbactam; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; ceftriaxone; ciprofloxacin; colistin; cotrimoxazole; gentamicin; imipenem; meropenem; metallo beta lactamase; piperacillin plus tazobactam; tetracycline; Acinetobacter baumannii; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; bla ndm 1 gene; bla oxa 23 gene; bla oxa 24 gene; bla oxa 58 gene; carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; controlled study; gene sequence; genetic variability; genotype; human; IS Aba125 gene; molecular epidemiology; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; priority journal; tertiary care center; Thailand,Article

Subjects on combined oral contraceptives also demonstrate a characteristic resistance to APC (activated protein C) in the thrombin generation assay. Here, we report the potential role of plasma factor IXa (FIXa) as a mechanism for hormone-induced systemic hypercoagulability. Approach and Results - A novel assay was used to determine FIXa activity in plasma samples from volunteer blood donors. Plasma from 36 premenopausal females on hormonal contraception and 35 not on hormonal contraception, 35 postmenopausal females, and 10 males were analyzed for FIXa activity, total PS (protein S), total tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and TFPI-α antigen. Premenopausal females on hormonal contraception demonstrated significantly increased FIXa activity and decreased TFPI-α compared with the other groups. Remarkably, FIXa values were not normally distributed in the hormonal contraception group, but skewed toward the high end. Plasma FIXa activity inversely correlated with both TFPI-α and total PS antigen. Ex vivo determination of TF-dependent FIX activation in FV-deficient plasma demonstrated that inhibitory anti-TFPI antibodies enhanced FIXa generation by 2- to 3-fold, whereas addition of 75 nmol/L PS reduced FIXa generation by ≈2-fold.

Direct measurement of Ks of a liquid or a biodiesel cannot be easily performed. The value has generally been obtained from the speed of sound and density through the Newton-Laplace equation. In this study, Ks values of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) reported in literatures are determined via direct correlation to the Gibbs free energy (associated with isentropic compression, ΔGKs) through the Gibbs energy additivity method. The derived equation lnks=lnA′+ [Formula presentes] with the numeric constants is then applied to estimate the Ks of biodiesels with good accuracy. Only the average carbon numbers and average number of double bond(s) of the biodiesel are required for the calculation. The estimated KS values at different temperatures are in good agreement with the conventional method of calculation from the speed of sound and density. The overall AAD for FAMEs was 0.08%, while the overall AAD for 16 different biodiesels (neat and blended) was 0.92%. Thus, the proposed model would facilitate the researchers to estimate the KS a FAME or a biodiesel. © 2017",Compressibility; Fatty acid methyl ester; Gibbs energy; QSRR,Acoustic wave velocity; Carbon; Compressibility; Esters; Fatty acids; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Average numbers; Carbon number; Conventional methods; Direct measurement; Fatty acid methyl ester; Isentropic compressibility; Isentropic compression; QSRR; Biodiesel,Article

We evaluated the accuracy of an immunochromatographic antigen test for diagnosis of chikungunya in a reference laboratory for arboviruses. Methods An immunochromatographic rapid test that uses mouse monoclonal antibodies as a tracer against the E1-envelope protein of chikungunya (ARKRAY, Inc. Kyoto, Japan) was evaluated. Sensitivity was tested in sera from travellers with RT-PCR confirmed chikungunya virus infection (Eastern/Central/Southern African (ECSA) genotype) (n=9) and from patients diagnosed during the 2014-2015 chikungunya outbreak on Aruba (Asian genotype, n=30). Samples from patients with other febrile and non-febrile illnesses (n=26), sera spiked with Flavivirus and Alphavirus reference strains (n=13, including non-spiked serum), and samples containing other selected pathogens (n=20) were used to test specificity of the E1-antigen test. Results Sensitivity of the E1-antigen test was 8/9 (88.9%, 95% CI 56.5–98.0) for the ECSA genotype, but only 10/30 (33.3%, 95% CI 19.2-51.2) for the Asian genotype. Overall diagnostic specificity was 49/59 (83.1%, 95% CI 71.5-90.5). Conclusions The E1-antigen test we evaluated had fair diagnostic sensitivity for ECSA genotype chikungunya, but low sensitivity for Asian genotype, and poor overall specificity. Antibodies that react across genotypes will be required for further development of a rapid test for chikungunya.

The purpose of this study was to compare the evaluation process in terms of feasibility, duration of the test, participants/administrator preference, and the results of cognitive test between cTMSE and the standard Thai Mental State Examination (sTMSE). Methods: Twenty-two elderly participants (>60 years old) who were not demented and 22 patients with mild-to-moderate dementia were included in the study. All participants would be asked to have TMSE by standard method (sTMSE) and computer-based method (cTMSE), at least 2 weeks and up to 2 months apart. Scores and duration of the test were compared using dependent paired t-test. Agreement of the tests between two methods and Kappa statistics were analyzed. Results: Paired t-test showed no significant difference in scores between the two methods (mean sTMSE vs. cTMSE: 22.84 vs. 22.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-0.465] to 0.987, P = 0.524). Percent of agreement between the two methods was 92.5%, with the Kappa of 0.85 (P < 0.001). Duration of the test by sTMSE was slightly shorter than the cTMSE (7.31 min vs. 7.97 min, 95% CI: [-1.159] to [-0.175], P = 0.09). Overall, participants liked being tested by cTMSE more than sTMSE.

Objective: To investigate critical incidents occurring in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit [PACU]. Materials and Methods: Structured incident reports were requested to be filled in by anesthesia provider and/or site manager of 22 hospitals in Thailand. Critical incidents of interest occurred in the PACU between January 1 and December 31, 2015 and were sent for review by three senior anesthesiologists. Discussion and consensus was used to resolve any discrimination among reviewers. Descriptive statistics were used. Results: Among 333,219 anesthetics, there were 221 incidents (10.5%) of the first 2,000 incident reports that occurred in the PACU. The most common critical incidents were respiratory complications (81%) such as reintubation (50.7%), oxygen desaturation (50.2%), suspected emergence delirium (6.6%), and anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid or allergic reaction (5.7%). Four cardiac arrests occurred with two deaths within 24 hours. Conclusion: Twenty percent of the incidents were considered preventable. Regarding the model of anesthesia related adverse events, the contributing factors were inappropriate decision making, inadequate preanesthetic evaluation, and inexperience. The factors minimizing incidents were vigilance and having experience. Suggested corrective strategies are quality assurance activities, training, improvement of supervision, and communication. A handoff procedure using checklists was suggested for further improvement. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

We sought to identify potential new risk factors for ventilator-associated condition and infection-related ventilator-associated complication in the PICU population. Design: Matched case control study. Setting: Children's hospital at a tertiary care academic medical center. Patients: During the study period, 606 patients were admitted to PICU and ventilated more than 48 hours; 70 children met ventilator-associated condition criteria. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We applied the definition for ventilator-associated condition (i.e., a sustained increase in ventilator settings after a period of stable or decreasing support) to our database. Within ventilator-associated condition cases, 40 cases were infection-related ventilator-associated complication and 30 cases were noninfectious-related ventilator-associated condition. We identified 140 controls and matched to ventilator-associated condition cases with regard to age, immunocompromised status, and ventilator days to event. Patients with ventilator-associated condition had longer ICU stay versus controls; 24 days median (12-43 interquartile range) versus 7 days (4-14); (p < 0.01), respectively, and longer duration of ventilatory support 17 days (10-32) versus 6 days (3-10); p < 0.01, respectively. Mortality was 22.8% in the ventilator-associated condition versus 9% in the control group (p < 0.01). A multivariate regression analysis adjusted for Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 identified mean peak inspiratory pressure and acute kidney injury to be associated with ventilator-associated condition (odds ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.22] and odds ratio, 2.85 [1.43-5.66], respectively). Acute kidney injury and neuromuscular blockade in a multivariate regression analysis adjusted for Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 were associated with infection-related ventilator-associated complication (odds ratio, 2.36 [1.03-5.40] and 3.19 [1.17-8.68], respectively). Conclusions: There is an association between ventilator-associated condition and infection-related ventilator-associated complication in critically ill children with acute kidney injury, ventilatory support, and neuromuscular blockade. Attention should be given by clinical practitioners to recognize these modifiable risk factors and to implement strategies to decrease the prevalence of ventilator-associated events. © 2017 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies.",critical care; infection-related ventilator-associated complication; neuromuscular blockade; ventilator-associated pneumonia,neuromuscular blocking agent; acute kidney failure; artificial ventilation; case control study; child; controlled study; critically ill patient; diagnostic accuracy; female; hospital based case control study; hospital mortality; human; hypervolemia; infection risk; length of stay; major clinical study; male; neuromuscular blocking; pediatric intensive care unit; prevalence; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; Review; sensitivity and specificity; tertiary health care; ventilator associated pneumonia,Review

One of the important problems in the management of shellfish allergy is the lack of accurate diagnostic assay because the biological and immunological properties of allergens in black tiger shrimp have not been well characterized. This study aims to detect proteins with the ability to bind and cross-link immunoglobulin E (IgE) from black tiger shrimp by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and a humanized rat basophilic leukemia reporter cell line RS-ATL8. Methods: Sera from shrimp allergic subjects were subjected to ELISA and Western blots using raw or cooked shrimp extract as antigens. Pooled sera were used to sensitize the RS-ATL8 reporter cell line and cells were activated by shrimp extract. Eluted protein extracts separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were tested on the RS-ATL8 cell line and subjected to mass spectrometry to identify potential candidate allergens. Results: Allergic sera reacted stronger to raw shrimp extract than cooked shrimp extract (P=0.009). Western blot demonstrated that major IgE reactivity protein bands were at 32-39 kDa and 91-230 kDa in both raw and cooked shrimp extracts. The eluted protein bands at the molecular weight of 38 and 115 kDa from raw shrimp extract induced IgE cross-linking as assayed by the RS-ATL8 cell line.

Patients with CKD-S have generally good survival that approximates patients who do not have CKD even after renal cancer surgery (RCS), yet there may be heterogeneity within this cohort. Patients and Methods: From 1997 to 2008, 4 246 patients underwent RCS at our centre. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up was 9.4 (7.3–11.0) years. New baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was defined as highest GFR between nadir and 6 weeks after RCS. We retrospectively evaluated three cohorts: no-CKD (new baseline GFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2); CKD-S (new baseline GFR of &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 but preoperative GFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2); and CKD due to medical aetiologies who then require RCS (CKD-M/S, preoperative and new baseline GFR both &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Analysis focused primarily on non-renal cancer-related survival (NRCRS) for the CKD-S cohort. Kaplan–Meier analysis assessed the longitudinal impact of new baseline GFR (45–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2) and Cox regression evaluated relative impact of preoperative GFR, new baseline GFR, and relevant demographics/comorbidities. Results: Of the 4 246 patients who underwent RCS, 931 had CKD-S and 1 113 had CKD-M/S, whilst 2 202 had no-CKD even after RCS. Partial/radical nephrectomy (PN/RN) was performed in 54%/46% of the patients, respectively. For CKD-S, 641 patients had a new baseline GFR of 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 290 had a new baseline GFR of &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed significantly reduced NRCRS for patients with CKD-S with a GFR of &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to those with no-CKD or CKD-S with a GFR of 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (both P ≤ 0.004), and competing risk analysis confirmed this (P &lt; 0.001). Age, gender, heart disease, and new baseline GFR were all associated independently with NRCRS for patients with CKD-S (all P ≤ 0.02). Conclusion: Our data suggest that CKD-S is heterogeneous, and patients with a reduced new baseline GFR have compromised survival, particularly if &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Our findings may have implications regarding choice of PN/RN in patients at risk of developing CKD-S. © 2017 The Authors BJU International © 2017 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",chronic kidney disease; kidney cancer; partial nephrectomy; radical nephrectomy; survival,"adult; African American; age; all cause mortality; Article; cancer specific mortality; cancer surgery; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; gender; glomerulus filtration rate; heart disease; human; hypertension; kidney cancer; major clinical study; male; mortality; non renal cancer related survival; overall survival; partial nephrectomy; priority journal; radical nephrectomy; retrospective study; survival; aged; cause of death; chronic kidney failure; comparative study; complication; Kaplan Meier method; kidney function test; kidney tumor; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; nephrectomy; pathology; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; prognosis; proportional hazards model; register; risk assessment; severity of illness index; survival analysis; United States; Adult; Aged; Cause of Death; Cohort Studies; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Kidney Function Tests; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Nephrectomy; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; United States",Article

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle protecting the entry of therapeutic agents to central nervous system, especially for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Thus, the use of small nanoparticle as a drug carrier may be new strategies to overcome this problem. In this study, we fabricated liposome consisting of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) functionalized with anti-CD20 (Rituximab; RTX). The designed nanoparticles have a theranostic property which is not only to improve drug delivery, but also to offer diagnostic and monitoring capabilities. TEM images revealed the spherical shape of liposome with the approximately average diameters about 140–190 nm with slightly negatively charge surfaces. Superparamagnetic property of SPIONs-loaded liposomes was confirmed by VSM. Liposome colloidal could be prolonged at 4 °C and 25 °C storages. RTX conjugated liposome induced cell internalization and apoptosis effect in B-lymphoma cells. Drug targeting and therapeutic effect was investigated in BBB model. The result confirmed that liposome nanocarrier is required as a drug carrier for effectively RTX across the BBB. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Anti-CD20; Blood brain barrier (BBB); Brain lymphoma; Liposome; Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL); Rituximab; Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPIONs); Theranostics,Blood; Cell death; Diagnosis; Diseases; Liposomes; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Neurophysiology; Oncology; Superparamagnetism; Anti-CD20; Blood-brain barrier; Central nervous systems; Rituximab; Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles; Theranostics; Iron oxides; liposome; rituximab; superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; blood brain barrier; controlled study; drug delivery system; internalization; lymphoma cell; mouse; nonhuman; primary central nervous system lymphoma; priority journal; theranostic nanomedicine; tumor xenograft,Article

Data-driven recommendations for TMJ imaging protocol are needed to reduce measurement error and scanning time. This study compares the impact of different protocols, imaging coils, and magnet strength on the reliability of image assessment and the subjective quality of images. Materials and methods Three groups of bilateral TMJ MR studies were retrospectively collected from two institutions, including 24 1.5 T and 19 3.0 T studies using dedicated TMJ surface coils, and 23 1.5 T studies with head coil. Post-contrast sequences were re-compiled from the full protocol to create minimum protocol studies for the three groups. Two radiologists and two non-radiologists first scored the three minimum protocol images according to pre-specified definitions, then scored the full protocol images. Minimum-to-full protocol agreement, inter-reader agreement, and subjective item visibility scores were assessed. Results With dedicated TMJ dual surface coils, minimum-vs-full protocol agreement was moderate to good (0.5–0.8 intraclass correlation coefficients or kappa) for most items, and was not influenced by the magnet strength. Inter-reader reliability was more significantly influenced by the imaging coil and reader's training background than by protocol length or magnet strength differences. Sagittal and coronal planes weighted on PD, T2 Fat Suppressed and T1 Fat Suppressed -postcontrast adequately visualized all the different features, whereas the axial plane was more limited to visualizing synovium. Conclusion Inter-reader reliability and qualitative measure of image quality improved more consistently with the coil offering the higher resolution, rather than increased magnet strength. © 2017",1.5 and 3.0 T magnets; Juvenile idiopathic arthritis; MRI protocols; Reliability; Temporomandibular joints,adolescent; Article; bone erosion; child; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; female; human; image quality; interrater reliability; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; male; mandible condyle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; qualitative analysis; signal noise ratio; synovitis; temporomandibular joint; temporomandibular joint disc,Article

To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine whether this seasonality exists in the UK, identify the peak months and describe seasonality by age. The monthly number of UTI consultations (N = 992 803) and nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim prescriptions (N = 1 719 416) during 2008-2015 was extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a large nationally representative UK dataset of electronic patient records. Negative binomial regression models were fitted to these data to investigate seasonal fluctuations by age group (14-17, 18-24, 25-45, 46-69, 70-84, 85+) and by sex, accounting for a change in the rate of UTI over the study period. A September to November peak in UTI consultation incidence was observed for ages 14-69. This seasonality progressively faded in older age groups and no seasonality was found in individuals aged 85+, in whom UTIs were most common. UTIs were rare in males but followed a similar seasonal pattern than in females. We show strong evidence of an autumnal seasonality for UTIs in individuals under 70 years of age and a lack of seasonality in the very old. These findings should provide helpful information when interpreting surveillance reports and the results of interventions against UTI.

To effect significant reduction in short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, and advance clinical care and research, coordination of multiple medical, surgical, behavioral, and basic scientific disciplines is required. On March 2, 2017, an investigator-driven meeting was held immediately before the American Academy of Dermatology Annual meeting for the central purpose of assembling, for the first time in the United States, clinicians and scientists from multiple disciplines involved in SJS/TEN clinical care and basic science research. As a product of this meeting, this article summarizes the current state of knowledge and expert opinion related to SJS/TEN covering a broad spectrum of topics including epidemiology and pharmacogenomic networks; clinical management and complications; special populations such as pediatrics, the elderly, and pregnant women; regulatory issues and the electronic health record; new agents that cause SJS/TEN; pharmacogenomics and immunopathogenesis; and the patient perspective. Goals include the maintenance of a durable and productive multidisciplinary network that will significantly further scientific progress and translation into prevention, early diagnosis, and management of SJS/TEN. © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",Electronic health record; Granulysin; HLA; Networks; Pharmacogenomics; Pharmacovigilance; Stevens-Johnson; T cells; Toxic epidermal necrolysis,clinical feature; cost effectiveness analysis; drug hypersensitivity; drug safety; drug surveillance program; early diagnosis; electronic health record; food and drug administration; geriatrics; health care management; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; immunopathogenesis; interdisciplinary research; morbidity; mortality rate; nonhuman; patient assessment; pediatrics; pharmacogenetic testing; pharmacogenomics; practice guideline; pregnant woman; psychological aspect; quality of life; rare disease; Review; Singapore; Stevens Johnson syndrome; toxic epidermal necrolysis; urogenital tract disease,Review

In many countries throughout Asia, physicians are yet to appreciate the significant contribution of BP variability to cardiovascular events. Furthermore, data from Japanese cohort studies have shown that there is a strong association between morning BP surge and cardiovascular events, suggesting that Asians in general may benefit from more effective control of morning BP. We designed the Asia BP@Home study to investigate the distribution of hypertension subtypes, including white-coat hypertension, masked morning hypertension, and well-controlled and uncontrolled hypertension. The study will also investigate the determinants of home BP control status evaluated by the same validated home BP monitoring device and the same standardized method of home BP measurement among 1600 or more medicated patients with hypertension from 12 countries/regions across Asia. ©2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Asia; blood pressure control; home blood pressure monitoring; hypertension,antihypertensive agent; adult; Article; Asian; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure regulation; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; disease classification; female; home monitoring; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; masked morning hypertension; priority journal; standardization; study design; validation study; white coat hypertension,Article

International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of proposed standards was assessed in a 20-centre study. The mean ISI for RBT/16 was 1.21 with a between-centre coefficient of variation of 4.6%. The mean ISI for rTF/16 was 1.11 with a between-centre coefficient of variation of 5.7%. Summary: Background The availability of International Standards for thromboplastin is essential for the calibration of routine reagents and hence the calculation of the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Stocks of the current Fourth International Standards are running low. Candidate replacement materials have been prepared. This article describes the calibration of the proposed Fifth International Standards for thromboplastin, rabbit, plain (coded RBT/16) and for thromboplastin, recombinant, human, plain (coded rTF/16). Methods An international collaborative study was carried out for the assignment of International Sensitivity Indexes (ISIs) to the candidate materials, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for thromboplastins and plasma used to control oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin K antagonists. Results Results were obtained from 20 laboratories. In several cases, deviations from the ISI calibration model were observed, but the average INR deviation attributabled to the model was not greater than 10%. Only valid ISI assessments were used to calculate the mean ISI for each candidate. The mean ISI for RBT/16 was 1.21 (between-laboratory coefficient of variation [CV]: 4.6%), and the mean ISI for rTF/16 was 1.11 (between-laboratory CV: 5.7%).

Two groups of specimens were classified applying the techniques: sprayed and premixed methods. AR-Glass was used with fiber content of 3 to 4% by volume. GFRC was mixed and applied different techniques with proportions of Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) content of 0%, 3%, 6%, and 9% by weight of cement. Compressive and flexural strength tests were performed at 1 and 28 days. Drying shrinkage tests were measured up to 98 days. The results obtained showed that increasing the SBR content showed a lower compressive strength of GFRC for both sprayed and premixed techniques. In the other hand, 28-day flexural strength results of GFRC for both premixed and sprayed techniques were found to increase with increasing SBR content. The GFRC mixes using sprayed technique exhibited flexural strength higher than the corresponding mixes using premixed technique because of the two-dimensional layer of fiber alignment for the sprayed technique. Increasing the SBR content exhibited the lower drying shrinkage of GFRC. At the age of 98 days, the drying shrinkage of GFRC using 9% SBR content was about 40% lower than that of GFRC using 0% SBR content. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,Bending strength; Compressive strength; Concretes; Drying; Fiber reinforced materials; Fibers; Glass; Glass fibers; Shrinkage; Styrene; Compressive and flexural strengths; Drying shrinkages; Fiber alignment; Fiber contents; Glass fiber reinforced concrete; Polymer content; Premixed; Styrene butadiene rubber; Reinforced concrete,Conference Paper

The Performance Value (PV) was considered for selecting the representative driving cycle. This selected driving cycle was then used as input data for estimating emission factors of 4 air pollutants and 3 greenhouse gases by the International Vehicle Emission (IVE) model. Results were then compared with emission factors developed using the European Transient Cycle (ETC). Additionally, a comparison was made between emission factors calculated in this study and direct measurements of emissions from truck driven on chassis dynamometer under the European driving cycle. Comparison results revealed that CO, NOx and CO2 emission factor were about 2.05, 2.24 and 1.78 times lower than those obtained from direct measurements. PM emission factor was about 0.89 times higher than measured data.

Our purpose is to assess the reliability and validity of Thai-version of Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 in chronic rhinosinusitis. Methods: Permission for translation of SNOT-22 from English language to Thai language was obtained from the developer. The translation process was done based on the international standard of translation method. A total of 80 subjects were recruited into the study and divided into two groups comprising of 50 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and 30 healthy volunteers. Cronbach's α and Intraclass correlation coefficient were evaluated for its reliability. Validity test was evaluated against VAS score, SF-36 (Thai version) questionnaire and CT scan (based on Lund-Mackay score). Responsiveness was assessed between pre-operative and post-operative scores in 34 patients. Results: The Thai version of SNOT-22 showed good reliability according to high value of Cronbach's α coefficient (r = 0.929) and intraclass correlation coefficient (r = 0.935). It also showed good validity by its ability to differential the patients with chronic rhinosinusitis from normal (p < 0.001), and different severity of symptoms (p < 0.05). In addition, the SNOT-22 Thai version also showed good responsiveness when compared between pre-operative and post-operative scores (p < 0.001) and also well-performed in effect size calculation (1.37). Conclusion: We demonstrated that Thai -version of SNOT-22 has good reliability and validity, suitable for evaluation of chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms together with severity of the disease and response to treatment.

The aetiologies of these potentially vaccine-preventable infections have not been well established in Cambodia. Methods: We did a one year prospective study of children hospitalised with suspected CNS infection at Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens (CSF) samples underwent culture, multiplex PCR and serological analysis to identify a range of bacterial and viral pathogens. Viral metagenomics was performed on a subset of pathogen negative specimens. Results: Between 1st October 2014 and 30th September 2015, 284 analysable patients were enrolled. The median patient age was 2.6 years; 62.0% were aged <5 years. CSF white blood cell count was ≥10 cells/μL in 116/272 (42.6%) cases. CNS infection was microbiologically confirmed in 55 children (19.3%). Enteroviruses (21/55), Japanese encephalitis virus (17/55), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7/55) accounted for 45 (81.8%) of all pathogens identified. Of the pathogens detected, 74.5% (41/55) were viruses and 23.6% (13/55) were bacteria. The majority of patients were treated with ceftriaxone empirically. The case fatality rate was 2.5%.

In addition, intervention combinations can have complex interactions at the population level, which are often difficult to adequately assess with standard study designs and analytical methods. Discussion: Herein, we urge the adoption of a new paradigm for the design and interpretation of intervention trials in infectious diseases, particularly with regard to emerging infectious diseases, one that more accurately reflects the dynamics of the transmission process. In an increasingly complex world, simulations can explicitly represent transmission dynamics, which are critical for proper trial design and interpretation. Certain ethical aspects of a trial can also be quantified using simulations. Further, after a trial has been conducted, simulations can be used to explore the possible explanations for the observed effects. Conclusion: Much is to be gained through a multidisciplinary approach that builds collaborations among experts in infectious disease dynamics, epidemiology, statistical science, economics, simulation methods, and the conduct of clinical trials. © 2017 The Author(s).",Clinical trial design; Infectious diseases; Mathematical modeling; Simulations; Vaccine,analytic method; Article; clinical trial (topic); disease simulation; disease transmission; dispersity; host pathogen interaction; infection; infection prevention; infectious agent; intervention study; medical ethics; study design; communicable disease; computer simulation; ethics; human; methodology; Clinical Trials as Topic; Communicable Diseases; Computer Simulation; Humans; Research Design,Article

Although mycobacteria are rarely the causative pathogens, it is important to recognize and treat them differently from non-mycobacterial infections. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics, associated factors and long-term outcomes of mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial PJI. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of patients aged ≥18 years who were diagnosed with PJI of the hip or knee at Siriraj Hospital from January 2000 to December 2012. Patient characteristics, clinical data, treatments and outcomes were evaluated. Results: A total of 178 patients were included, among whom 162 had non-mycobacterial PJI and 16 had mycobacterial PJI. Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) (11) and M. tuberculosis (MTB) (5) were the causative pathogens of mycobacterial PJI. PJI duration and time until onset were significantly different between mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial PJI. Infection within 90 days of arthroplasty was significantly associated with RGM infection (OR 21.86; 95% CI 4.25-112.30; p < .001). Implant removal was associated with improved favorable outcomes at 6 months (OR 5.96; 95% CI 1.88-18.88; p < .01) and 12 months (OR 3.96; 95% CI 1.15-13.71; p = .03) after the infection. Conclusions: RGM were the major pathogens of early onset PJI after THA and TKA. Both a high clinical index of suspicion and mycobacterial cultures are recommended when medically managing PJI with negative cultures or non-response to antibiotics.

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of S. asper leaf extracts (SA-EE) against toxicity of glutamate-mediated oxidative stress, a crucial factor contributing to the neuronal loss in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying mechanism as well as to evaluate its longevity effect. Methods: Using mouse hippocampal HT22 as a model for glutamate oxidative toxicity, we carried out MTT and LDH assays including Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining to determine the SA-EE effect against glutamate-induced cell death. Antioxidant activities of SA-EE were evaluated using the radical scavenging and DCFH-DA assays. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, SA-EE treated cells were analyzed for the expressions of mRNA and proteins interested by immunofluorescent staining, western blot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) techniques. The longevity effect of SA-EE was examined on C. elegans by lifespan assay. Results: We demonstrate that a concentration-dependent reduction of glutamate-induced cytotoxicity was significant after SA-EE treatment as measured by MTT and LDH assays. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide and immunofluorescent staining showed that co-treatment of glutamate with SA-EE significantly reduced apoptotic-inducing factor (AIF)-dependent apoptotic cell death. DCFH-DA assay revealed that this extract was capable of dose dependently attenuating the ROS caused by glutamate. Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR showed that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein levels in the nucleus, as well as mRNA levels of antioxidant-related genes under Nrf2 regulation were significantly increased by SA-EE.

In such cases, engineered tissue grafts hold the potential to restore function and improve patient quality of life. Requirements for successful integration of engineered tissue grafts with the host musculature include cell alignment that mimics host tissue architecture and directional functionality, as well as vascularization to ensure tissue survival. Here, we have developed biomimetic nanopatterned poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) substrates conjugated with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a potent angiogenic and myogenic factor, to enhance myoblast and endothelial maturation. Primary muscle cells cultured on these functionalized S1P nanopatterned substrates developed a highly aligned and elongated morphology and exhibited higher expression levels of myosin heavy chain, in addition to genes characteristic of mature skeletal muscle. We also found that S1P enhanced angiogenic potential in these cultures, as evidenced by elevated expression of endothelial-related genes. Computational analyses of live-cell videos showed a significantly improved functionality of tissues cultured on S1P-functionalized nanopatterns as indicated by greater myotube contraction displacements and velocities. In summary, our study demonstrates that biomimetic nanotopography and S1P can be combined to synergistically regulate the maturation and vascularization of engineered skeletal muscles. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",nanotopography; skeletal muscle; sphingosine-1-phosphate; tissue engineering; vascularization,Biomaterials; Biomimetics; Gene expression; Genes; Muscle; Musculoskeletal system; Nanotechnology; Sphingosines; Tissue; Computational analysis; Contraction displacement; Nanopatterned substrates; Nanotopographies; Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid; Skeletal muscle; Sphingosine; Vascularization; Tissue engineering,Article

Hence the investigation of flexible needle insertion into inhomogeneous tissue is necessary. In this work, we examine the flexible needle insertion into three-layered phantom tissue. In particular, needle shape determination is executed by the method that was proposed previously, which combines a novel model that treats the needle as an inextensible elastic rod and curvature measurement through fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors embedded in the needle. Experiments on needle insertion into three-layered tissue are performed, then we evaluate the method.

The readily available and rapidly growing pool of viral sequence data in the public domain enable the identification and characterization of immune targets relevant to adaptive immunity. A systematic bioinformatics approach is necessary to facilitate the analysis of such large datasets for selection of potential candidate vaccine targets. Results: This work describes a computational methodology to achieve this analysis, with data of dengue, West Nile, hepatitis A, HIV-1, and influenza A viruses as examples. Our methodology has been implemented as an analytical pipeline that brings significant advancement to the field of reverse vaccinology, enabling systematic screening of known sequence data in nature for identification of vaccine targets. This includes key steps (i) comprehensive and extensive collection of sequence data of viral proteomes (the virome), (ii) data cleaning, (iii) large-scale sequence alignments, (iv) peptide entropy analysis, (v) intra- and inter-species variation analysis of conserved sequences, including human homology analysis, and (vi) functional and immunological relevance analysis. Conclusion: These steps are combined into the pipeline ensuring that a more refined process, as compared to a simple evolutionary conservation analysis, will facilitate a better selection of vaccine targets and their prioritization for subsequent experimental validation. © 2017 The Author(s).",Bioinformatics; Database; Reverse vaccinology; Target discovery; Tools; Vaccine design; Viral diversity,peptide; virus vaccine; Article; bioinformatics; conserved sequence; data analysis; data processing; Dengue virus; drug design; drug targeting; entropy; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Influenza A virus; nonhuman; priority journal; sequence alignment; sequence homology; species comparison; species diversity; species identification; virus; virus strain; West Nile virus,Article

A total of 72 features were extracted from each view for analysis. Performances of the considered features are evaluated with an application to mammogram classification. A deep neural network (DNN) classifier was used as a supervised learning in the classification. Performances of the features are evaluated by three measures: Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy. The results showed that for the CC view, Mean of Areas of microcalcification spots, Mean of Major Axis Lengths of microcalcification spots performed better than the other features, followed by Mean of Minor Axis Lengths of microcalcification spots and Mean Diameter of all microcalcifications; for the MLO view, Mean of Perimeters of microcalcification spots, and Mean Diameter of all microcalcifications performed better than the other features, followed by Mean of Contrasts of microcalcification spots, and Diffuseness (standard deviation of inter-distances of all microcalcifications in the ROI).

This paper proposes a robust method to re-identify persons using their face shapes based on the Active Shape Model (ASM) and the Procrustes Shape Analysis (PSA). The ASM-based technique is used to extract landmark points of each face image, as the feature. Then, the Procrustes Distance (PD) is used to measure the similarity between two ASMs of any two face images. In addition, the trained ASMs of each subject can be grouped into clusters, using the PD-based K-mean clustering. Then, the Procrustes Mean Shape (PMS) is computed for each cluster using all belonging ASMs. In stead of using ASM of individual face image, the PMS is used as the representative face model. This process is performed to increase the robustness and reduce the number of models representing each subject. The proposed method is evaluated on the well-known face datasets and the real-world scenario of the security guard re-identification under the real environment. The experimental results and comprehensive comparisons show a very promising performance of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.",Active shape model; Human re-identification; Procrustes distance; Procrustes mean shape; Procrustes shape analysis,Clustering algorithms; Human computer interaction; Active Shape Models; Procrustes distance; Procrustes mean shape; Procrustes shape analysis; Re identifications; Image processing,Conference Paper

With regard to this, one of the money supply sources to strengthen the financial stability is Gross Domestic Saving (GDS) which consists of savings from the public sector, the private corporate sector, and the household sector. Unfortunately, World Bank reports that the average GDS values of many countries have been generally declining in the past five years. On the contrary, Bank of International Settlements shows that the debt of the household sector has critically risen and the debt consequently leads to different levels of problems such as personal stress, crime commission, and bankruptcy cases. Research has revealed that to alleviate such problems the financial capability is extremely needed especially long term savings behavior. To ensure such behavior, three challenges are identified. First of all, the learning process of money management should start since the childhood and secondly parents need to be involved in guiding their children. Finally, there must be a mechanism to maintain the retention level of children throughout this process. Focusing on these challenges, KeptAom is proposed as a savings management tool that focuses on promoting long term savings behavior for children with the engagement of their families. KeptAom composes of three components - KeptAom on Cloud, KeptAom on Mobile, and KeptAom on Piggybank. With KeptAom, children can set and fulfill their goals by saving their money and completing various chores given from their parents; on the other hand, parents can observe and interact with their children through KeptAom's notification. KeptAom deploys the gamification concept and a digital cashless piggy bank to increase the engagement of children in order to ensure repeating uses which is a potential method to lead to long term savings behavior in the future. © 2017 IEEE.",Financial Stability; Gamification; Internet of Things; Savings Behavior,Internet of things; Corporate sector; Financial stability; Gamification; Household sectors; Management systems; Potential methods; Retention levels; Savings Behavior; Finance,Conference Paper

The system comes with the GUI running on Kali Linux which is specifically designed for ethical hacking. PENTOS automatically gathers the information of the target IoT device through the wireless communication, which are WiFi and Bluetooth. The system allows users to perform various kinds of penetration testing on their IoT devices such as the password attack, web attack, and wireless attack in order to gain the privilege access by multiple algorithms. Moreover, the system also provides the basic security guidance according to the OWASP's Top 10 IoT Vulnerabilities to educate users and increase the security awareness.

Both HMP and CS are developed base on the suitable conditions that can maintain the kidney function. In this study, the vascular impedance of kidney was investigated. This experiment aims to comparison the impedance between HMP and CS methods by using a kidney of pig from slaughterhouse. The protocol of impedance estimation, after the kidney was remove from pig (mixed breed pigs), it was gravity flushing to wash blood out. After that, each kidneys were measured impedance before the preservation method. For HMP method, other 3 kidneys were preserved with continuous flow of Euro's Collins preservation solution that maintain pressure around 40 ± 5 mmHg at temperature 4-6 °C for 24 hours. For CS method, 3 kidneys were kept in chamber that filled with Euro's Collins preservation solution at temperature 4-6 °C for 24 hours. After 24 hours, impedance estimation was performed. Results: from the first impedance estimation, both HMP and CS impedances were 0.957±0.95 and 1.024±0.05 mmHg min/ml, respectively. After 24 hours, the impedance of HMP method were higher than CS method (1.059±0.09 and 1.028±0.009 respectively). Conclusion, the kidney preservation using HMP show higher impedance than CS method because the autoregulation in the kidney vascular system that effect to the metabolite phenomenon. Therefore, the HMP preservation can preserving kidneys better than CS preservation. © 2017 IEEE.",cold storage; Hypothermic machine perfusion; impedance; kidney preservation,Biomedical engineering; Cardiovascular system; Electric impedance; Mammals; Autoregulations; Continuous flows; Hypothermic; Impedance estimation; Kidney transplantation; Measured impedance; Preservation methods; Suitable conditions; Cold storage,Conference Paper

Thus, they are amongst high priority groups for routine vaccination. However, vaccine-induced immune responses and effectiveness were reported as relatively low. This study aims to systemically compare the immune responses elicited by intramuscular (IM) and intradermal (ID) injections with inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine among the older age group. Methods A prospective, open-label, randomized study with a total of 221 adults (>60 years) were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups. Group I (n = 111) received an IM inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine while Group II (n = 110) received the same vaccine ID. Demographics and co-morbidity were collected at baseline. Safety data was collected 3 days post-vaccination using diary card. HAI, NAb and NAI titers were assessed prior to vaccination and at 30, 45, and 60 days post-vaccination. Data was analyzed using SPSS 11.5. Results Both groups had similar BMI and co-morbidity. For ID and IM groups, significant differences were observed for seroconversion rate measured using HAI against H1N1 and H3N2 (58/111 vs 44/110 and 68/111 vs 54/110, respectively) being higher for those aged 60–65 years. However, no differences in HI antibody against B/Phuket were seen. For ID route, history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension were factors associated with high seroconversion rate towards influenza A (p =.001). The seroconversion rate risk ratio were 1.31 and 1.25 (p <.05) against A/California/07/09(H1N1) and A/Songkha/308/13 (H3N2), respectively. Interestingly, the GMT (95% CI) of baseline NAI antibodies among both groups were high (56.57 and 54.01 in the ID and IM groups, respectively). A 4-fold increase measured by NAI against A/California/07/09 (H1N1) were detected in 16.67% and 20% of participants who received ID or IM vaccination, respectively. Conclusions The seroconversion rates of HAI, NAb and NAI were modest, especially in those >65 years of age. However, it was higher in the ID group as compared to the IM group.

However, a DPI firewall with a large volume of traffic can lead to a high packet drop rate, high delay, and the poor network throughput. One possible way to relieve the firewall workload is to deploy multiple firewalls and select only suspicious traffic to check with the firewall. To perform this task, we apply the Software Defined Network (SDN) concept by using the OpenFlow standard. We develop a system called Reactive Firewall System with OpenFlow and Flow Monitoring System (REFLO) to distribute traffic to multiple firewalls and bypass non-suspicious traffic. REFLO system is able to select the most appropriate firewall for each data flow based on the contents of the flow and rules set by administrators on the OpenFlow controller. In addition, REFLO allows administrators to easily monitor the network by visualizing the flow summarization and flow statistics on our web application. To verify the effectiveness of our system, we deploy OpenFlow switches by using the low-cost Raspberry Pi boards and deploy OpenFlow controller and the web application on an Ubuntu PC. Experimental results also confirm that REFLO can achieve the lower average packet delay and higher throughput than that of the existing firewall system. © 2017 IEEE.",Firewall; Network Monitoring; Openflow; Software-Defined Network,Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Software defined networking; Deep packet inspection (DPI); Firewall; Flow statistics; Network Monitoring; Network throughput; Openflow; Openflow switches; Packet drop rates; Monitoring,Conference Paper

On such a case, an endotracheal tube (ETT) must be inserted into patient's airway and following by a balloon cuff blowing in order to fix and act as a sealed artificial airway for an artificial ventilation. However, those implementations adversely affect to tracheal tissue-epithelial layer and probably damaging a larynx and vocal cord zone. After a ventilator weaning and an extubating process, some patients always suffering with a larynx or tracheal edema symptom or postextubation stridor (PES) in which patient airway is narrowed or swelling due to a long term pressurization by the ETT balloon cuff. This mainly causes a difficulty in a spontaneous breathing. In general, a cuff leak test is a common medical maneuver used in order to predict a larynx or tracheal edema possibility after ETT was removed. Air volume different between an inspired volume (Vtì) and an expired volume (Vie) normally should be higher than 100 mL or 10%. In this paper, we propose an investigation of an airflow pattern on an intubated patient in the cuff leak test process in order to understand and support a prediction of the tracheal edema before perform an ETT extubation. The study was performed in an intubated trachea by using a simulation of an airflow pattern, air volume prediction in a normal intubated case and during cuff leak test process with no edema and edema case. Although, this simulation was intently implemented in a simple intubated trachea model, however the obtain results imply us a practical information and will be used as a basic implementation for a further study, especially in case of variety in the ETT intubation or cuff less ventilation even more complication case in the near future. © 2017 IEEE.",airway airflow pattern; CFD; cuff leak test; larynx-trachea edema; stirdor sound,Balloons; Biomedical engineering; Computational fluid dynamics; Flow patterns; Forecasting; Testing; Air volumes; Airflow patterns; Artificial ventilation; Intubated patients; larynx-trachea edema; Leak tests; Respiratory failure; Spontaneous breathing; Respiratory system,Conference Paper

In general, a raw X-ray image acquired directly from a digital flat detector contains poor quality of image, which may not be suitable for diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, a pre-processing technique is usually required to enhance image quality. This paper presents an improved image enhancement on digital chest radiography using the so-called N-CLAHE method, which is based on global and local enhancement. The proposed technique consists of two main steps. Firstly, intensity correction of the raw image is encountered by the log-normalization function which adjusts the intensity contrast of the image dynamically. Secondly, the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) method is used for enhancing small details, textures and local contrast of the images. The proposed approach was tested using a radiographic survey phantom and a radiographic chest phantom and compared with conventional enhancement methods, such as histogram equalization, unsharp masking, CLAHE. The results show that the proposed N-CLAHE method yields great improvement on the pre-processing correction for digital chest radiography. © 2017 IEEE.",Chest radiography; CLAHE; Image enhancement; X-ray imaging,Biomedical engineering; Digital image storage; Equalizers; Graphic methods; Phantoms; X ray detectors; X ray radiography; Chest radiography; CLAHE; Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE); Film processing; Histogram equalizations; Treatment planning; Unsharp masking; Xray imaging; Image enhancement,Conference Paper

The aim of this article was to apply and develop techniques for wound healing therapies in fish by using low dose microwave which could be able to generate an option and better clinical outcome to fish with treatment limitations. Twenty-four healthy adult Nile Tilapias were used and randomly divided into two groups. Both of them were formed a 1×1 skin wound on both sides of dorsal musculature and then treated with enrofloxacin immersion while only the microwave treatment group was exposed to microwave therapy with a frequency of 2,450 MHz, and a dose of 62 mW/cm2 with 1 Hz pulse for 30 min once per day. Wound healing was evaluated by measuring the percentage of healing, daily healing, and histological parameters. The percentage of healing and daily healing in comparison were similar patterns except a few day after the incision, the control showed a greater significant reduction area. The histological change of microwave group was appearing rapidly entering of cuboidal cell and alignment of basement membrane and mark different in inflammatory cell infiltration. Base on our results, we conclude that the application of microwave can be a usefulness option for wound healing in fish without abnormal behavior, external signs and gross lesions.

The mechanism of the extensive neurological impairments of hosts caused by A. cantonensis larvae remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate apoptosis, necroptosis and autophagy in the brains of mice infected with A. cantonensis, which will be valuable for better understanding the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis cantonensis. Methods: Functional and histological neurological impairments of brain tissues from mice infected with A. cantonensis were measured by the Morris water maze test and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, respectively. The transcriptional and translational levels of apoptosis-, necroptosis- and autophagy-related genes were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. Apoptotic and necroptotic cells and their distributions in infected brain tissues were analysed by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Inflammatory response in the central nervous system deteriorated as A. cantonensis infection evolved, as characterized by abundant inflammatory cell infiltration underneath the meninges, which peaked at 21 days post-infection (dpi). The learning and memory capacities of the mice were significantly decreased at 14 dpi, indicating prominent impairment of their cognitive functions. Compared with those of the control group, the mRNA levels of caspase-3, -4, -6, and RIP3 and the protein levels of caspase-4, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-6, RIP3, and pRIP3 were obviously elevated. However, no changes in the mRNA or protein levels of FADD, Beclin-1 or LC3B were evident, indicating that apoptosis and necroptosis, but not autophagy, occurred in the brain tissues of mice infected with A. cantonensis. The quantitative RT-PCR, western blot, IHC, flow cytometry and TEM results further revealed the apoptotic and necroptotic microglia, astrocytes and neurons in the parenchymal and hippocampal regions of infected mice. Conclusions: To our knowledge, we showed for the first time that A. cantonensis infection causes the apoptosis and necroptosis of microglia and astrocytes in the parenchymal and hippocampal regions of host brain tissues, further demonstrating the pathogenesis of A. cantonensis infection and providing potential therapeutic targets for the management of angiostrongyliasis. © 2017 The Author(s).",Angiostrongylus cantonensis; Apoptosis; Necroptosis; Pathogenesis,beclin 1; caspase 3; caspase 4; caspase 6; eosin; Fas associated death domain protein; hematoxylin; LC3B protein; messenger RNA; peptides and proteins; RIP3 protein; unclassified drug; angiostrongyliasis; Angiostrongylus cantonensis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; astrocyte; cell infiltration; cognition; controlled study; deterioration; female; flow cytometry; hippocampus; immunohistochemistry; learning; limit of quantitation; memory; microglia; Morris water maze test; mouse; necroptosis; nerve cell; nonhuman; pathogenesis; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; transmission electron microscopy; Western blotting,Article

Mammals have six GATA and two FOG factors. We recently demonstrated that interactions between retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and GATA-1 are crucial for erythroid proliferation and differentiation. We show here that the LXCXE pRb-binding site of FOG-2 is involved in adipogenesis. Unlike GATA-1, which inhibits cell division, FOG-2 promotes proliferation. Mice with a knockin of a Fog2 gene bearing a mutated LXCXE pRb-binding site are resistant to obesity and display higher rates of white-to-brown fat conversion. Thus, each component of the GATA/FOG complex (GATA-1 and FOG-2) is involved in pRb/E2F regulation, but these molecules have markedly different roles in the control of tissue homeostasis.

Complete safety evaluation is not usually incorporated in efficacy studies due to financial and human resource constraints. This review reports the methods used for the assessment of safety of artemisinin-based and quinine-based treatments in efficacy studies in pregnancy. Methods: Methodology of assessment and reporting of safety in efficacy studies of artemisinin-based and quinine-based treatment in pregnancy was reviewed using seven databases and two clinical trial registries. The protocol was registered to PROSPERO (CRD42017054808). Results: Of 48 eligible efficacy studies the method of estimation of gestational age was reported in only 32 studies (67%, 32/48) and ultrasound was used in 18 studies (38%, 18/48). Seventeen studies (35%, 17/48) reported parity, 9 (19%, 9/48) reported gravidity and 13 (27%, 13/48) reported both. Thirty-eight studies (79%, 38/48) followed participants through to pregnancy outcome. Fetal loss was assessed in 34 studies (89%, 34/38), but the definition of miscarriage and stillbirth were defined only in 11 (32%, 11/34) and 7 (21%, 7/34) studies, respectively. Preterm birth was assessed in 26 studies (68%, 26/38) but was defined in 16 studies (62%, 16/26). Newborn weight was assessed in 30 studies (79%, 30/38) and length in 10 studies (26%, 10/38). Assessment of birth weight took gestational age into account in four studies (13%, 4/30). Congenital abnormalities were reported in 32 studies (84%, 32/38). Other common risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes were not well-reported. Conclusion: Incomplete reporting and varied methodological assessment of pregnancy outcomes in anti-malarial drug efficacy studies limits comparison across studies. A standard list of minimal necessary parameters to assess and report the safety component of efficacy studies of anti-malarials in pregnancy is proposed. © 2017 The Author(s).",Malaria; Methodology; Pregnancy; Review; Safety,antimalarial agent; artemisinin; quinine; adverse outcome; Article; birth weight; cohort analysis; congenital disorder; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug screening; echography; fetus wastage; gestational age; human; malaria falciparum; methodology; observational study; parity; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; risk factor; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; systematic review,Article

Such sintering is accountable for a surface densification that can preserve the MWCNTs entity within the composites. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of MWCNTs in the composites, with NaxCoO2 being present as a single phase (γ) as revealed by X-ray diffraction. EDX results suggested non-uniform distribution of MWCNTs within the NaxCoO2 material, although their presence resulted in increased electrical conductivity through enhancements in charge mobility. The effect of MWCNTs addition on the thermoelectric performance of NaxCoO2 was examined. Addition of MWCNTs results in increased levels of phonon scattering in the composites, leading to decreased thermal conductivity. Although Seebeck coefficients decreased due to an increase in charge density, the thermoelectric efficiency of the composites reported as ZT values was enhanced in comparison to those in material without added MWCNTs, with optimum conditions found in composites derived from 0.25 wt%MWCNTs/NaxCoO2 (with ZT enhancement by ca. 60% at 398 K). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",Composite; Flame sintering; Multi-walled carbon nanotube; Sodium cobalt oxide; Thermoelectric properties,Carbon nanotubes; Characterization; Cobalt; Composite materials; Gamma rays; Nanotubes; Sintering; Sodium; Thermoelectricity; X ray diffraction; Yarn; Electrical conductivity; Non-uniform distribution; Sodium cobalt oxide; Surface densification; Thermoelectric characterization; Thermoelectric efficiency; Thermoelectric performance; Thermoelectric properties; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN),Article

Recently, NREL-certified record PCE of PSC is 22.1%, which is competing to silicon solar cells has been reported. However, PSC devices are environmentally sensitive leading to a rapid PCE degradation. Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of the role of various parameters to achieve highly stable PSC without compromising on its performance. This review contains an overview of a recent progress in PSC with respect to PCE, materials engineering, and stability.

However, timely initiation, optimal titration, and proper adherence to prescribed basal insulin regimens are necessary to achieve optimal glycemic control. Even so, glycemic control may remain suboptimal in a significant proportion of patients. Unique circumstances in Asia (eg, limited resources, management of diabetes primarily in nonspecialist settings, and patient populations that are predominantly less educated) coupled with the limitations of current basal insulin options (eg, risk of hypoglycemia and dosing time inflexibility) amplify the challenge of optimal basal insulin therapy in Asia. Significant progress has been made with long-acting insulin analogs (insulin glargine 100 units/mL and insulin detemir), which provide longer coverage and less risk of hypoglycemia over intermediate-acting insulin (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin). Furthermore, recent clinical evidence suggests that newer long-acting insulin analogs, new insulin glargine 300 units/mL and insulin degludec, may address some of the unmet needs of current basal insulin options in terms of risk of hypoglycemia and dosing time inflexibility. Nevertheless, more can be done to overcome barriers to basal insulin therapy in Asia, through educating both patients and physicians, developing better patient support models, and improving accessibility to long-acting insulin analogs. In this study, we highlight the unique challenges associated with basal insulin therapy in Asia and, where possible, propose strategies to address the unmet needs by drawing on clinical experiences and perspectives in Asia. © 2017 Chan et al.",Insulin degludec; Insulin detemir; Insulin glargine; Insulin titration; Patient education,hemoglobin A1c; insulin; insulin aspart; insulin degludec; insulin detemir; insulin glargine; insulin lispro; isophane insulin; Asian; diabetes education; drug cost; drug dose increase; drug dose titration; drug formulation; drug safety; drug withdrawal; evening dosage; glycemic control; hospitalization; human; hypoglycemia; insulin treatment; lifestyle modification; low drug dose; medication compliance; morning dosage; mortality; needle phobia; nocturnal hypoglycemia; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient compliance; patient worry; peer group; Review; treatment refusal,Review

Increasing the HTC temperature from 180 to 240 °C resulted in carbonaceous materials with increased sulfur content and less adsorbed water. The material obtained at 220 °C (WH-PTSA-220) contains the highest amount of acid sites and promotes the highest initial rate of two transformations, that is, methanolysis of oleic acid and dehydration of xylose to furfural. While all PSTA-treated WH catalysts gave comparable fatty acid conversions (≈97 %) and furfural yields (≈60 %) after prolonged reaction times, the WH-PTSA-240 system bearing a relatively low acid density maintains the most favorable reusability profile. Higher HTC temperatures (220–240 °C) improved the catalyst reusability profiles due to graphitization and hydrophobicity of the carbon surface.

Premenopausal women should be advised of the potential effect of anticoagulant therapy on menstrual bleeding at the time of treatment initiation. Consequences of HMB should be assessed and treated on an ongoing basis. In the acute setting, the decision to withhold anticoagulants is based on an individual patient’s risk of thrombosis and the severity of the bleeding. For women who require long-term anticoagulation, a levo-norgestrelintrauterinesystem,tranexamic acid (during menstrual flow), high-dose progestin-only therapy, or combined hormonal contraceptives are effective for controlling HMB. The risk of thrombosis during anticoagulant therapy with these treatments is not well studied but is likely to be low.

We aim to discuss ethical challenges in enrolling pregnant women in research as a part of large pregnancy cohort study in Laos. From 2013 to 2015, a prospective cohort study was conducted with 1000 pregnant women in a rural area of Vientiane, Laos, to determine whether fevers were associated with maternal morbidity and small for gestational age. Incidence of fever was 10% and incidence of small for gestational age was 12%. Level of education, cultural norms about family decision-making, and misconceptions about healthcare during pregnancy were three common issues encountered in enrolling pregnant women to this study. Only 47% of recruited women had completed primary school with no further education, which could affect the decisions women make to participate and remain in the study. Family decision-making is common in Laos; in some cases, we could not recruit pregnant women without agreement from their families. In Laos, many pregnant women and their families had strong beliefs in travelling during late pregnancy or losing small amount of blood (giving ~5 ml blood sample) could negatively impact their pregnancies. These misconceptions affected not only the quality of the study but also the women's opportunities to access healthcare. Good engagement between the research team and study participants, and the provision of more health information to the community, were essential to reducing issues experienced in enrolling pregnant women in this study. © 2017 The Author(s).",Cohort; Culture; Decision-making; Infection; Lao; Misconception; Mortality; Pregnancy,academic achievement; Article; cohort analysis; congenital disorder; cultural factor; family decision making; female; fever; health belief; health care access; human; incidence; Laos; maternal care; maternal morbidity; maternal mortality; medical ethics; medical information; medical research; newborn death; pregnant woman; primary school; prospective study; rural area; small for date infant; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; therapeutic misconception,Article

The aim of this review is to present the currently available evidence from both observational and interventional cohort studies on anti-malarial efficacy in pregnancy and summarize the variability of assessment and reporting found in the review process. Methods: Efficacy methodology and assessment of artemisinin-based treatments (ABT) and quinine-based treatments (QBT) were reviewed systematically using seven databases and two clinical trial registries (protocol registration-PROSPERO: CRD42017054808). Pregnant women in all trimesters with parasitologically confirmed uncomplicated falciparum malaria were included irrespective of symptoms. This review attempted to re-calculate proportions of treatment success applying the same definition as the standard WHO methodology for non-pregnant populations. Aggregated data meta-Analyses using data from randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments were performed by random effects model. Results: A total of 48 eligible efficacy studies were identified including 7279 treated Plasmodium falciparum episodes. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in 24 studies for differentiating recurrence, the assessment and reporting of treatment efficacy was heterogeneous. When the same definition could be applied, PCR-corrected treatment failure of ≥ 10% at any time points was observed in 3/30 ABT and 3/7 QBT arms. Ten RCTs compared different combinations of ABT but there was a maximum of two published RCTs with PCR-corrected outcomes for each comparison. Five RCTs compared ABT and QBT. Overall, the risk of treatment failure was significantly lower in ABT than in QBT (risk ratio 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.63), although the actual drug combinations and outcome endpoints were different. First trimester women were included in 12 studies none of which were RCTs of ABT. Conclusions: Efficacy studies in pregnancy are not only limited in number but use varied methodological assessments. In five RCTs with comparable methodology, ABT resulted in higher efficacy than QBT in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Individual patient data meta-Analysis can include data from observational cohort studies and could overcome some of the limitations of the current assessment given the paucity of data in this vulnerable group. © 2017 The Author(s).",Artemisinin; Efficacy; Malaria; Methodology; Pregnancy; Quinine; Review,amodiaquine; amodiaquine plus artesunate; artemether; artemether plus benflumetol; artemisinin; artesunate; atovaquone plus proguanil; chlorproguanil plus dapsone; clindamycin; dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine; mefloquine; pyrimethamine plus sulfadoxine; quinine; Article; cohort analysis; drug efficacy; drug treatment failure; evidence based medicine; first trimester pregnancy; human; intervention study; low drug dose; malaria falciparum; meta analysis; methodology; nonhuman; observational study; outcome assessment; parasitology; Plasmodium falciparum; polymerase chain reaction; pregnancy; pregnant woman; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; standardization; symptom; systematic review; treatment response; world health organization,Article

Purpose: To examine the effects of DOM supplementation on the cerebral hemodynamic response during physical exertion in young and middle-aged men. Design: Double-blind placebo-controlled crossover studies were conducted in young (N = 12, aged 21.2 ± 0.4 years) and middle-aged men (N = 9, aged 46.8 ± 1.4 years). The counter-balanced trials of DOM and Placebo were separated by a 2-week washout period. DOM and Placebo were orally supplemented in drinks before, during, and after cycling exercise. DOM comprises desalinated minerals and trace elements from seawater collected ~618 m below the earth's surface. Methods: Cerebral hemodynamic response (tissue hemoglobin) was measured during cycling at 75% VO2max using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Results: Cycling time to exhaustion at 75% VO2max and the associated plasma lactate response were similar between the Placebo and DOM trials for both age groups. In contrast, DOM significantly elevated cerebral hemoglobin levels in young men and, to a greater extent, in middle-aged men compared with Placebo. An increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was observed in middle-aged men, 2 h after exhaustive cycling, but was attenuated by DOM. Conclusion: Our data suggest that minerals and trace elements from deep oceans possess great promise in developing supplements to increase the cerebral hemodynamic response against a physical challenge and during post-exercise recovery for middle-aged men. © 2017 Wei, Chen, Liao, Tsai, Huang, Chaunchaiyakul, Higgins and Kuo.",Aging; Inflammation; Minerals; Muscle power; Rehydration; Trace elements,deep ocean mineral; hemoglobin; lactic acid; mineral; sea water; trace element; unclassified drug; adult; Article; cerebral hemodynamics; controlled study; crossover procedure; cycling; double blind procedure; exercise; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; inflammation; lactate blood level; male; middle aged; near infrared spectroscopy; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; normal human; randomized controlled trial,Article

Methods: This is a retrospective chart review study. A total of 167 eyes (96 patients) consisting of 71 AAC eyes, 71 fellow eyes of AAC, and 25 PACS eyes were recruited. All patients underwent ocular examination and biometry. The mechanism of AAC was confirmed by ultrasound biomicroscopy. We then subdivided AAC eyes into four subgroups: crowded-angle (CR), lens subluxation (LS) pupillary block (PB), and plateau iris syndrome (PL). Outcome variables included anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), vitreal length (VL), axial length (AL), lens position and relative lens position (LP and RLP, respectively), and lens axial length factor (LAF). Results: Among the three groups, ACD was shallower in AAC eyes than fellow eyes of AAC and PACS eyes (p < 0.01 for both) and AAC eyes demonstrated a lesser LP and RLP. The LT, VL, AL, and LAF were not significantly different among the three groups. Among the four subgroups, LS displayed the most shallow ACD (p = 0.01). The lens position in PL was greater than in CR and LS (p < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively). Conclusions: AAC eyes had a more anterior lens position than fellow eyes and PACS eyes, though lens thickness did not differ among the groups. As such, an anterior lens position may offer more sensitive prognostication regarding future development of AAC compared to lens thickness. © 2017 The Author(s).",Acute angle-closure; Angle-closure; Biometry; Ultrasound biomicroscopy,"aged; analysis of variance; anterior eye chamber; biometry; closed angle glaucoma; diagnostic imaging; eye axis length; female; human; lens; male; middle aged; pathology; procedures; retrospective study; vitreous body; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Anterior Chamber; Axial Length, Eye; Biometry; Female; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; Humans; Lens, Crystalline; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Vitreous Body",Article

Previous studies implied that TR2 and TR4 act largely in a redundant manner during erythroid differentiation; however, during the course of routine genetic studies, we observed multiple variably penetrant phenotypes in the Tr4 mutants, suggesting that indirect effects of the mutation might be masked by multiple modifying genes. To test this hypothesis, Tr41/2 mutant mice were bred into a congenic C57BL/6 background and their phenotypes were reexamined. Surprisingly, we found that homozygous Tr4 null mutant mice expired early during embryogenesis, around embryonic day 7.0, and well before erythropoiesis commences. We further found that Tr41/2 erythroid cells failed to fully differentiate and exhibited diminished proliferative capacity. Analysis of Tr41/2 mutant erythroid cells revealed that reduced TR4 abundance resulted in decreased expression of genes required for heme biosynthesis and erythroid differentiation (Alad and Alas2), but led to significantly increased expression of the proliferation inhibitory factor, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (Cdkn1c). These studies support a vital role for TR4 in promoting erythroid maturation and proliferation, and demonstrate that TR4 and TR2 execute distinct, individual functions during embryogenesis and erythroid differentiation. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1C; nuclear receptor NR2C2; nuclear receptor NR2C2; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; bone marrow cell; cell differentiation; cell maturation; cell proliferation; controlled study; embryo development; embryonic stem cell; erythroid cell; erythropoiesis; flow cytometry; genetic background; leukocyte; mean corpuscular hemoglobin; mean corpuscular volume; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; red blood cell distribution width; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thrombocyte; thrombocyte volume; anemia; animal; blood; cell proliferation; cytology; erythroid cell; gene expression regulation; genetics; heterozygote; homozygote; knockout mouse; lethal gene; lymphopoiesis; metabolism; mutation; myelopoiesis; Anemia; Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Erythroid Cells; Erythropoiesis; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Lethal; Heterozygote; Homozygote; Lymphopoiesis; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mutation; Myelopoiesis; Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group C, Member 2",Article

However, EpCAM expression reported in previous immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies was inconsistent. We hypothesize that the membrane-distal part of EpCAM may be lost during tissue preparation, leaving only the membrane-proximal part of EpCAM available for antibody binding and IHC staining. Methods: Two new anti-EpCAM MAbs to the membrane-proximal part (WC-2) and the membrane-distal part (WC-1) of EpCAM were generated and characterized. WC-2 was selected for its ability to detect EpCAM in cervical tissues by IHC. One hundred thirty-five archival paraffin-embedded tissues previously diagnosed as cervical SCC (n=44), high-grade (HSIL) (n=43), or low-grade (LSIL) (n=48) squamous intraepithelial lesions were examined. IHC score was collected, recorded, and analyzed for distribution, intensity, and percentage of cancer cells stained for EpCAM. Results: EpCAM expression was consistently detected on cervical tissues by WC-2, but not by WC-1. EpCAM was expressed with high IHC score in the majority of cervical SCC (37/44), but not in normal epithelial area adjacent to SCC. EpCAM was also highly expressed on precancerous lesion of the cervix, particularly in HSIL. More importantly, EpCAM expression could be used to distinguish between HSIL and LSIL, according to staining distribution. HSIL tissues displayed EpCAM expression in two-thirds to full thickness of the epithelium, while in LSIL the staining was limited to the lower one-third of the thickness. The IHC score of EpCAM expression was strongly correlated with cervical cancer and grades of precancerous lesions (r=0.875, p<0.001). Conclusion: Only the anti-EpCAM MAb to the membrane-proximal part is able to detect EpCAM on paraffin-embedded cervical cancer tissues. A strong positive correlation between EpCAM expression level and the grades of SILs provides the possibility that EpCAM can be used to predict prognosis and severity in these patients. © 2017 The Author(s).",Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM); Immunohistochemistry (IHC); Membrane-distal part; Membrane-proximal part; Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC),epithelial cell adhesion molecule; monoclonal antibody; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer grading; disease association; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; protein determination; protein expression; squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix; tissue membrane; uterine cervix carcinoma; uterine cervix carcinoma in situ; uterine cervix epithelium,Article

However, there are often situations where it is inconvenient to dry the swabs without running the risk of contamination, or where only plastic bags are the best option for packaging material. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of using 70% ethanol (v/v) and 100% isopropanol (v/v) to prevent or delay microbial growth on cotton swabs containing biological evidence and their effects on the subsequent STR analysis. The alcohols was applied on cotton swabs as moistening agent prior to collection of dried saliva stains. The cotton swabs were then packaged immediately in sealable plastic bags and stored at room temperature (27–29 °C) for up to 5 days to simulate improper storage conditions. DNA was extracted and then amplified using AmpFLSTR® Identifiler® Plus PCR Amplification kit to obtain STR profiles. The results showed no observable fungal growth on any of the swabs moistened with 70% ethanol (v/v) or 100% isopropanol (v/v), and full STR profiles could be obtained from these swabs, while the growth was observed on swabs moistened with sterile deionised water after 5 days.

Various laser treatments have been employed to remove the epidermis and cause dermal wound and heating with subsequent dermal collagen remodeling. Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of a variable square pulse Erbium: YAG (VSP Er:YAG) laser for the treatment of striae in skin phototypes III-IV. Methods: Twenty-one women with SD were treated monthly for 2 months with VSP Er:YAG laser resurfacing using a 7-mm spot size. One side of their striae was randomly treated with one pass of 400 mJ in short pulse (SP) mode with 50% overlapping and one pass of 2.2 J/cm2 in smooth (SM) mode with nonoverlapping. The other side of their striae was treated with two passes of 400 mJ in SP mode with 50% overlapping. Objective and subjective assessments were obtained at baseline and 1-, 3-, and 6-month after treatment. Results: In both SP&amp;SM and SP only group, volume of SD measured by Visioscan VC98 reduced significantly at 6-month follow-up visit (P=.017 and P=.034, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in skin roughness (SER), skin smoothness (SESM), and surface measured by Visioscan VC98. Transient postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is the common side effect found in patients with darker skin tone even in nonsun exposure areas and can last as long as 6 months.

As there are often large volumes of samples to process, a streamlined sample collection and analysis protocol suitable for urine samples that is quick, reliable, and economical would be highly advantageous. FTA® cards have been employed extensively for preparing and preserving genetic material for long periods of time at room temperature. This study reports the possibility of using FTA® cards to store urinary DNA, which can be used directly as templates in STR analysis for human identification. Urine samples from six male and female volunteers were collected. The sample preparation steps for harvesting cells from urine, such as minimum urine volume required and centrifugal speed, were optimised, and suitable sizes of the FTA® card punches were determined. The results showed that regardless of the sample donor's sex, a complete DNA profile could be reproducibly generated from a single 2.0-mm punch of the 3-mL urine samples that had been deposited on FTA® cards using the standard PCR conditions for AmpFLSTR® Identifiler® Plus. The developed protocol could become an integral part of a guideline for authentication of urine samples submitted for doping control or forensic toxicological analysis, where cost per sample and storage space are factors of consideration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",DNA; FTA® card; Sample authentication; STR profiling; Urine,Article; DNA determination; doping; female; human; human cell; male; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; toxicology; urine sampling; urine volume,Article

However, poor patient tolerance of glucose solutions is common. We aim to compare the diagnostic value of an ice cream test with a standard OGTT. Materials and Methods: A total of 104 healthy adults were randomly assigned to either 75-g OGTT or ice cream, followed by a crossover to the other test. Results: Most patients were females (71%). Mean age was 37 ± 12 years, and body mass index was 24.2 ± 3.9 kg/m2. Diabetes mellitus and IGT, as diagnosed by 75-g OGTT, were 4.8% and 6.7%, respectively. The 2-hour plasma glucose levels were 110 ± 55.5 mg/dL with 75-g glucose and 97.52 ± 40.7 mg/dL with ice cream. The correlation coefficient of 2-hour plasma glucose for the 2 tests was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75-0.87; P &lt; 0.001). Discordant diagnostic results, based on 2-hour plasma glucose levels, were 9.61%. By using a combination of fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour plasma glucose values, the ice cream test would have missed 5.76% of those at high risk for diabetes mellitus (impaired fasting glucose and IGT) or diabetes. Conclusions: An ice cream test may serve as an alternative to a 75-g OGTT.

The integrity of these cells and their alterations are involved in the pathogenesis of numerous gastric disorders. Omeprazole, a gastric acid secretion blocker, is commonly used for gastrointestinal diseases due to its antioxidative stress and anti-inflammatory properties. Little is known regarding how omeprazole modulates the re-epithelialized effect on gastric mucosal cells associated with gastrointestinal disorders. The present study aimed to determine whether omeprazole attenuates parietal and chief cell damage in association with its antioxidative property. An in vivo ethanol-induced gastritis rat model was used. Histopathological, scanning and transmission electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical studies were performed. The results revealed that omeprazole improved the gastric mucosal surface, and reduced the severity of mucosal inflammation and hemorrhaging. Notably, ethanol-induced gastritis caused dysmorphic rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) in chief cells, which was accompanied by mitochondrial swelling. This alteration was modulated by omeprazole due to its antioxidant effect characterized by upregulation of superoxide dismutase in gastric mucosal cells. In addition, expression of aquaporin-4 was increased in the omeprazole treatment group, which may be due to the expansion of regenerative parietal cells and acid suppression. The results of the present study suggest that omeprazole preserves the RER in chief cells and enhances parietal cell regeneration through its antioxidative property by exerting anti-inflammatory effects. © 2017, Spandidos Publications.

Material and Method: We retrospectively reviewed 490 definitely diagnosed NSCLC cases. Eighty-three individuals who met the criteria for clinical N0 NSCLC were enrolled. CT findings of these patients were reviewed for tumor side, tumor location, lobar involvement, tumor size, and histology. Prevalence and risk factors of occult intrathoracic lymph node metastasis were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Eighty-three patients with confirmed clinical N0 NSCLC were evaluated, including 44 men and 39 women, ages ranging from 38 to 86 years (mean 65.27±11.27). Prevalence of occult N1-2 (intrathoracic) and N2 (mediastinal) lymph node involvement were 15.7% (13/83) and 8.4% (7/83), respectively. According to univariate analysis, risk factors for occult N1-2 disease were left-sided tumor (p = 0.038), left lower lobe (LLL) tumor (p = 0.045), and clinical T2 tumor (p = 0.028). By multivariate analysis, risk factors for occult N1-2 disease included LLL tumor (p = 0.031) and clinical T2 tumor (p = 0.036). Clinical T2 tumor was identified as a significant risk factor for predicting occult N2 disease (p = 0.033). Conclusion: Prevalence of occult intrathoracic and mediastinal lymph node involvement in clinical N0 NSCLC patients were 15.7% and 8.4%, respectively. As such, preoperative cervical mediastinoscopy is recommended in N0 NSCLC patients with clinical T2 to rule out mediastinal lymph node involvement. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

However, the clear advantages and disadvantages of this method are still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare implant stability quotient (ISQ) values obtained from RFA with parameters obtained from a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan of the same region. Materials and methods Nineteen implants (Conelog) were inserted in the posterior maxillary and mandibular partially edentulous regions of 16 patients. At the time of implant placement, the ISQ values were obtained using RFA (Osstell). CBCT was used to measure the thickness of the crestal, cortical, buccolingual cortical, and cancellous bone at 3, 6, and 9 mm below the crestal bone level, as indicated by radiographic markers. The ratio of the thickness of the cortical to cancellous bone at varying depths was also calculated and classified into 4 groups (Group 1–4). Results There was a strong correlation between the crestal cortical bone thickness and ISQ values (P<0.001). The thickness of the buccolingual cortical bone and ratio of the cortical to cancellous bone thickness at 3 mm were significantly related to the ISQ (P = 0.018 and P = 0.034, respectively). Furthermore, the ISQs in Group 1 were the highest compared with those in Group 2 and Group 3, whereas the CBCT parameters at 6 and 9 mm did not have any specific correlation with the ISQ values. Conclusion This study showed that the ISQ values obtained from RFA highly correlated with the quantity and quality of bone 3 mm below the crestal bone level. The correlation between the ISQ and bone surrounding the implant site was dependent on the depth of measurement. Therefore, RFA can help to predict the marginal bone level, as confirmed in this study. © 2017 Chatvaratthana et al.

Materials and methods: Mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) was treated with either Pam2CSK4 or Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 ligands) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. At indicated time points, the treated cells were lysed. The gene and protein expression of SARM were determined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. For silencing of TLR9 function, the cells were transfected with TLR9 siRNAs before stimulation by these two TLR2 ligands Results: The SARM expression was upregulated at both transcriptional and translational levels in time-dependent manner during activation of Pam2CSK4 and Pam3CSK4 in mouse macrophages. Blocking of ligand internalization by cytochalasin D showed interference effect with SARM expression. Moreover, our results also demonstrated that endosomal acidification and TLR9 were required for SARM expression suggesting the essential role of endosomal compartment acidification and TLR9 in regulating SARM expression.

Cranial nerves such as acoustic and facial nerves, can be possibly damaged during tumor dissection. Proper surgical intervention should prevent neurological deficit and achieve total tumor removal. Conventionally, nerve function is qualitatively evaluated by surgeon and neurologist. Facial nerves can be preserved by monitoring the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) response. The differences in the amplitude and latency of CMAP are used as indicators during surgical interventions. However, baseline CMAPs cannot be recorded in the presence of large acoustic tumors. This paper presents a new way of estimating nerve function. Instead of a single CMAP examination, multi-CMAP responses are obtained from a train of varied stimulus intensities and these are applied a mathematical model. Shifts in the mathematical model parameters reflect changes in facial nerve function. In this study, experiments conducted in frog revealed that shifts in the linear model parameters were related to the level of induced nerve injury. Significant differences in the slope parameter of the linear model were found between each nerve condition. The identification of healthy and severed nerves via a support vector machine (SVM) corresponded to 94% accuracy. This classification criterion could be used with surgical intervention to prevent severed facial nerve palsy in acoustic neuroma surgery. The proposed method could be used to estimate nerve outcomes without prior information of a CMAP baseline. © 2017 The Authors.",Acoustic neuroma; CMAP; Electrical stimulation; Facial nerve preservation,acoustic neuroma; animal experiment; animal tissue; Anura; Article; controlled study; cranial nerve; electrostimulation; face muscle; facial nerve paralysis; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; muscle action potential; nerve compression; nerve function; nerve stimulation; nonhuman; peripheral nerve; sciatic nerve injury; support vector machine,Article

However, an association of serum Gpc4 and glucose metabolism remains contradictory. Study of serum Gpc4 in obese children has not been conducted. We aimed to determine serum Gpc4 levels in obese children with various degrees of obesity. Design, Patients and Measurements: Up to 370 overweight and obese children, aged 6-18 years were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed with fasting serum Gpc4, lipid profiles, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) measured. Insulin sensitivity and β-cell function indices were calculated from plasma glucose and serum insulin levels derived from the OGTT. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed for body fat determination. Comparisons of serum Gpc4 levels among the groups of children with various degrees of obesity were performed. Results: Serum Gpc4 levels progressively increased in children with increasing body mass index standard deviation score (BMI SDS) tertiles [median (interquartile range, IQR): 2.3 (1.8, 3.2), 2.6 (1.9, 3.4) and 3.2 (2.4, 3.8) μg/L, P<.001]. There were no differences in serum Gpc4 levels among children in the different glucose metabolism categories. Log serum Gpc4 levels were positively correlated with SDSs of weight and BMI, cholesterol, AST and ALT. No associations of log serum Gpc4 and insulin sensitivity and β-cell function indices were demonstrated. Conclusions: Serum Gpc4 levels were increased with increasing degrees of obesity.

To improve the diagnostic sensitivity, DNA methylation analysis is an attractive candidate, since this may constitute a stable marker in brushed specimens. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the importance of such epigenetic markers in brushed biliary cells from patients with obstructive jaundice for the diagnosis of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The cells examined were those that were left over from brushed cytology done during routine endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The methylation states of HOXA1, RASSF1A, P16, and NEUROG1 genes in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were measured by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and compared between brushed biliary cells and normal gall bladder epithelial cells. The results showed that the sensitivity of the methylation index measurements of HOXA1 and NEUROG1 genes from brushed samples was markedly superior to that of standard cytology. In conclusion, measurement of the DNA methylation status of HOXA1 and NEUROG1 genes in leftover brushed biliary cells might serve as a useful supplement in the detection of malignant biliary obstruction by increasing the sensitivity of diagnosis by routine cytology. © The Author(s) 2017.",brushed cytology; DNA methylation; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; obstructive jaundice,bisulfite; adult; aged; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cell differentiation; clinical outcome; comparative study; controlled study; DNA methylation; female; gene; gene inactivation; HOXA1 gene; human; human tissue; image analysis; male; middle aged; NEUROG1 gene; obstructive jaundice; polymerase chain reaction; RASSF1A gene; very elderly,Article

Methods All thalassemia patients who underwent CMR were enrolled on a clinical 1.5T scanner. Native T1 mapping with the Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (MOLLI) technique, T2 mapping using a black-blood multi-echo spin-echo technique, and conventional T2* mapping using multi-echo gradient-echo techniques were performed. CIO was defined by a T2* of < 20 ms; while severe CIO was considered as < 10 ms. Results A total of 200 patients were enrolled in the study (23.9 ± 14.6 years old [mean ± SD], 102 male). Among these, 8 patients (4.0%) had CIO. Both native T1 and T2 times were significant different among patients with no CIO, mild-to-moderate CIO, and severe CIO (1012.7 ± 57.7 vs. 846.4 ± 34.4 vs 601.3 ± 34.6 ms for T1, p < 0.05; 59.6 ± 6.5 vs. 48.7 ± 2.5 vs. 32.8 ± 1.2 ms for T2, p < 0.05). The best cut-off values for detection of CIO were 887 and 52 ms for T1 and T2, respectively. This yielded a sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of 100%, 98.4% and 0.997 respectively for T1, in comparison to 100%, 88.8% and 0.961 respectively for T2. Conclusions Native T1 mapping can differentiate between severe, mild-to-moderate, and no CIO, which appears to be a promising technique for detection and assessment of myocardial iron. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cardiac magnetic resonance; Iron overload; T1 mapping; Thalassemia; Tissue characterization,iron; adult; Article; cardiac iron overload; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; controlled study; diagnostic value; disease severity; female; heart disease; human; image analysis; imaging and display; iron overload; major clinical study; male; modified look locker inversion recovery technique; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; reference value; sensitivity and specificity; thalassemia,Article

Polysaccharides from various seaweeds have shown anti-tumor activity. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), often with metastatic disease, is highly prevalent in Thailand as a consequence of liver fluke infection. Recently, we extracted sulfated galactans (SG) from Gracilaria fisheri (G. fisheri), a south east Asian seaweed, and found it exhibited anti-proliferation effect on CCA cells. Purpose In the present study, we evaluated the anti-migration activity of SG on CCA cells and its underlined mechanism. Methods CCA cells were treated with SG alone or drugs targeting to epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) or pretreated with SG prior to incubation with EGF. Anti-migration activity was determined using a scratch wound-healing assay and zymography. Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were used to investigate EGFR signaling mediators. Results Under basal condition, SG reduced the migration rate of CCA, which was correlated with a decrease in the active-form of matrix metalloproteinases-9. SG decreased expression of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), but increased expression of E-cadherin to promote cells stasis. Moreover, phosphorylation of EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), known to stimulate growth of cancer cells, was blocked in a comparable way to EGFR inhibitors Cetuximab and Erlotinib. Pretreatment cells with SG attenuated EGF induced phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK and FAK. Conclusion This study reveals that SG from G. fisheri retards migration of CCA cells, and its mechanism of inhibition is mediated, to some extent, by inhibitory effects on MAPK/ERK signal transduction pathway. Our findings suggest that there may be a therapeutic potential of SG in CCA treatment. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Anti-migration; Cholangiocarcinoma; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Gracilaria fisheri; Mitogen-activated kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases; Sulfated galactans,"antineoplastic agent; cetuximab; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; focal adhesion kinase; galactan; gelatinase B; mitogen activated protein kinase; uvomorulin; antineoplastic agent; cadherin; CDH1 protein, human; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor; epidermal growth factor receptor; focal adhesion kinase 1; galactan; mitogen activated protein kinase; PTK2 protein, human; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cell migration; controlled study; drug effect; drug targeting; enzyme phosphorylation; Gracilaria fisheri; HuCC-A1 cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; immunofluorescence test; incubation time; premedication; priority journal; seaweed; signal transduction; sulfation; Western blotting; wound healing assay; zymography; bile duct carcinoma; bile duct tumor; cell motion; chemistry; drug effects; Gracilaria; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; seaweed; tumor cell culture; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Cadherins; Cell Movement; Cholangiocarcinoma; Epidermal Growth Factor; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Focal Adhesion Kinase 1; Galactans; Gracilaria; Humans; Phosphorylation; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Seaweed; Signal Transduction; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article

Material and Method: One hundred ninety-three Thai family caregivers of person with Alzheimer’s disease were studied. Exploratory factor analysis with principle component analysis and varimax rotation was performed to assess factor structures. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was calculated to estimate reliability. Results: The results revealed acceptable reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.77. Analysis of items in each dimension (caregivers’ stigma, lay persons’ stigma, and structural stigma) and a comparison between the original FS-ADS and the FS-ADS (Thai version) showed that two dimensions (caregivers’ stigma and lay persons’ stigma) had lower number of factors and lower cumulative percentages than the original version. However, an overall comparison between the two versions showed that each factor in the Thai version was similar to that of the original version. Conclusion: The overall results of exploratory factors analysis in the present study revealed good psychometric properties of the FS-ADS (Thai version). Accordingly, the FS-ADS (Thai version) was found to be a reliable and valid instrument for assessing stigmatization experienced by the Thai family caregivers providing care to persons with Alzheimer’s disease.

The transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been investigated in numerous clinical trials on various other diseases due to the self-renewal capacity of these cells and their potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types. The presence of excess reactive oxygen species in injured myocardium causes cardiac dysfunction and leads to inefficient repair of the heart. The poor outcomes of stem cell transplantation have been suggested to result from residual oxidative damage affecting the transplanted cells. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) and bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) in vitro, in order to provide information useful for the future selection of MSC types for cardiac differentiation and transplantation. H2O2 at concentrations of 200, 500 and 1,000 µM was applied to WJ-MSCs and BM-MSCs under cardiogenic differentiation conditions. The morphology of MSCs treated with H2O2 was similar to that of untreated cells, whereas the cell density decreased in direct association with the dose of H2O2. Cardiac differentiation markers were then evaluated by immunofluores-cence analysis of GATA4 and cardiac troponin T (cTnT). The fluorescence intensity levels of the two markers were identified to be diminished by increasing doses of H2O2 from 500 to 1,000 µM. The expression levels of homeobox protein Nkx2.5, cTnT and cardiac α-actin were also examined, and were identified to be low in the WJ-MSCs treated with 1,000 µM H2O2, which was similar to the findings observed in BM-MSCs. These results suggested that oxidative stress affects cardiomyocyte differentiation via the downregulation of cardiac genes and cardiac proteins. Furthermore, it should be noted that there was a marked difference in the effect depending on the source of MSCs. This evidence provided supportive information for the use of stem cells in transplantation. © 2017, Spandidos Publications.

Methods: The population pharmacokinetic properties of DHA and piperaquine were assessed in 16 healthy Thai adults using an open-label, randomized, crossover study. Drug concentration–time data and electrocardiographic measurements were evaluated with nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Results: The developed models described DHA and piperaquine population pharmacokinetics accurately. Concomitant treatment with primaquine did not affect the pharmacokinetic properties of DHA or piperaquine. A linear pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic model described satisfactorily the relationship between the individually corrected QT intervals and piperaquine concentrations; the population mean QT interval increased by 4.17 ms per 100 ng ml–1 increase in piperaquine plasma concentration. Simulations from the final model showed that monthly and bimonthly mass drug administration in healthy subjects would result in median maximum QT interval prolongations of 18.9 ms and 16.8 ms, respectively, and would be very unlikely to result in prolongation of more than 50 ms. A single low dose of primaquine can be added safely to the existing DHA–piperaquine treatment in areas of multiresistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Conclusions: Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation in healthy adult volunteers suggested that therapeutic doses of DHA–piperaquine in the prevention or treatment of P. falciparum malaria are unlikely to be associated with dangerous QT prolongation. © 2017 The Authors.

It has been postulated that GIH may control Vg synthesis by inhibiting the release of gonad-stimulating factor (GSF) from brain and thoracic ganglia. To prove this hypothesis, this study was primarily aimed to investigate the influence of GIH on the release of GSF from thoracic ganglia of Penaeus monodon. Our result showed that GIH did not suppress the release of putative GSF from thoracic ganglia by calcium ionophore A23187 as the induction of oocyte growth in the ovary explants that were cocultured with thoracic ganglia in the presence of A23187 was not affected by the addition of recombinant GIH protein. In addition and interestingly, when the ovary explants were incubated with the recombinant GIH alone, the oocyte growth was increased at the rate comparable to that induced by A23187 in the presence of thoracic ganglia. Hence, our in vitro study demonstrated that the stimulation of GSF released from thoracic ganglia is independent of GIH, and that the GIH has a dual function in oocyte growth stimulation and inhibition of Vg synthesis in the early stage of ovarian development.

High quality preserved spermatozoa has been reported to retain better motility and DNA quality. Objective: We showed the effect of semen preparation on the quality of cryopreservation of human spermatozoa. Material and Method: We compared cryopreserved spermatozoa separated by Sil-Select density gradient centrifugation before or after cryopreservation in terms of spermatozoa motility, morphology, and DNA integrity. Spermatozoa’s motility was determined by CASA; the morphology was determined by the eosin-methylene blue staining; and the DNA integrity was determined by TUNEL assay. Results: We found that semen preparation before or after cryopreservation produced spermatozoa with comparable motility and morphology. However, semen preparation before cryopreservation showed a significantly higher total motile spermatozoa count (8.48 [2.47 to 37.87] vs. 5.35 [0.29 to 17.30], p-value <0.05) and significantly better DNA integrity as indicated by less DNA fragmentation (21.34±3.01 vs. 24.29±3.01, p<0.001). Conclusion: We concluded that spermatozoa prepared by Sil-Select density gradient centrifugation before cryopreservation can improve quality of the preserved spermatozoa in terms of the total motile spermatozoa count and DNA integrity. © 2018, Medical Association of Thailand.

No previous study has compared efficacy between dorsal root entry zone lesioning (DREZL) and selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) for reduction of spasticity. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of DREZL and SDR for attenuating spasticity, and to compare efficacy between these two methods. Methods: All patients who underwent DREZL, SDR, or both for treatment of intractable spasticity caused by cerebral pathology at Siriraj Hospital during 2009 to 2016 were recruited. Severity of spasticity was assessed using Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Adductor Tone Rating Scale (ATRS). Ambulatory status was also evaluated. Results: Fifteen patients (13 males) with a mean age of 30.3 ± 17.5 years were included. Eight, six, and one patient underwent DREZL, SDR, and combined cervical DREZL and lumbosacral SDR, respectively. Eight of ten patients with preoperative bed-bound status had postoperative improvement in ambulatory status. Spasticity was significantly reduced in the DREZL group (p < 0.001), the SDR group (p < 0.001), and in overall analysis (p < 0.001). SDR was effective in both pediatric and adult spasticity patients. A significantly greater reduction in spasticity as assessed by MAS score (p < 0.001) and ATRS score (p = 0.015) was found in the DREZL group. Transient lower limb weakness was found in a patient who underwent SDR. Conclusions: DREZL is more effective for reducing spasticity, but is more destructive than SDR. DREZL should be preferred for bed-ridden patients, and SDR for ambulatory patients. Both operations are helpful for improving ambulatory status. Gait improvement was observed only in patients who underwent SDR.

Publications have shown that Abacavir (ABC) patch testing is useful in confirming ABC hypersensitivity in 24–50% of cases with a 100% sensitivity of HLA-B*5701 in patch test positive cases. However, Nevirapine (NVP) patch testing has not been reported. Objectives: (1) To evaluate the usefulness and safety of NVP patch testing in Thai HIV patients with NVP hypersensitivity. (2) To assess the correlation of positive patch tests with HLA-B*3505. Patients and methods: Patients were classified into two groups: (1) study group of 20 HIV NVP hypersensitivity patients and (2) control group of 15 volunteers without NVP hypersensitivity. Both groups were patch tested with purified and commercialized form of NVP in various vehicles. Results: Two HIV patients with NVP hypersensitivity were patch test positive. All controls tested negative. Three HIV patients were positive for HLA-B*3505 and the two patients with positive patch testing were both HLA-B*3505 positive. Conclusions: NVP patch testing in Thai HIV patients is safe and can be used to help confirm the association between NVP and hypersensitivity skin reactions.

This study aimed to assess pathogenic leptospiral carriage in Nan province, a rural area of Thailand where leptospirosis is endemic. Samples from 20 villages were obtained during the period 2013 to 2016, comprising urine samples collected from asymptomatic people (n=37) and domestic animals (n=342), and environmental water samples (n=14). Leptospira were cultured in Ellinghauson McCullough Johnson and Harris (EMJH) media. An rrs nested PCR identified 9.92% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.96–12.88) of the urine and water samples as being positive for Leptospira spp., and phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the 443bp amplicons. Leptospira weilii, which has not previously been identified in Thailand, was recovered from 13 cattle, 9 pigs, 2 dogs, 2 water samples and 1 goat. L. interrogans was found in 4 dogs, 3 pigs, 3 cattle, 1 human and 1 water sample. Four leptospiral strains were isolated and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed on these. Three novel sequence types were identified, including two singletons of L. interrogans in ST26 and ST33, and one of L. weilii in ST94, with this having a close relationship to previous isolates from cases of human leptospirosis in Laos and China. Our results revealed that pathogenic Leptospira occur commonly in asymptomatic domestic animals, humans and environmental water samples in Nan Province, and emphasize the high potential for zoonotic transmission in the province. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Domestic animals; Leptospira weillii; Nan province; Pathogenic Leptospira; Thailand; Zoonosis,animal husbandry; Article; controlled study; dark field microscope; DNA extraction; gene expression profiling; geographic distribution; housekeeping gene; human; Leptospira; Leptospira interrogans; Leptospira weilii; leptospirosis; molecular diagnosis; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; parasite isolation; parasite transmission; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; Thailand,Article

Methods: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was performed in the tertiary care center. Patients aged between 18 and 65 years who were American Society of Anesthesiologists class I–II and scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy with or without salpingo-oophorectomy were randomly allocated to a placebo or a pregabalin group. Patients received pregabalin 150 mg or placebo 1 h prior to anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia was achieved with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with morphine 0.2 mg. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia morphine was provided postoperatively. Postoperative morphine consumption at 6, 12, and 24 h, time to first analgesic rescue, pain scores, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction were evaluated at 24 h after the operation. Results: One hundred twenty-five patients were recruited and 119 patients (placebo N = 58, pregabalin N = 61) were included in the analysis. Forty-seven (81.0%) patients in the placebo group and 53 (86.9%) patients in the pregabalin group required morphine in the first 24 h. Median [IQR] 24-h morphine consumption was 4.0 [1.8, 10.0] mg in the placebo group and 5.0 [2.0, 11.0] mg in the prebagalin group, p = 0.60. There were no differences in cumulative morphine consumption at 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively. The two groups also did not differ in time to first analgesic rescue, pain scores at rest and on movement, and side effects. Conclusion: A single preoperative dose of pregabalin 150 mg did not reduce 24-h postoperative morphine consumption or pain scores or prolong the time to first analgesic rescue in spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine. © 2017, Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists.",Acute pain; Hysterectomy; Postoperative pain; Pregabalin; Spinal anesthesia,"bupivacaine; fentanyl; midazolam; morphine; paracetamol; placebo; pregabalin; propofol; analgesic agent; bupivacaine; morphine; pregabalin; abdominal hysterectomy; adult; aged; Article; breathing rate; comparative study; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug use; electrocardiography; female; heart rate; human; hysterectomy; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; numeric rating scale; outcome assessment; oxygen saturation; patient controlled analgesia; patient satisfaction; postoperative pain; power analysis; randomized controlled trial; salpingooophorectomy; single drug dose; spinal anesthesia; surgical patient; tertiary care center; adolescent; hysterectomy; ovariectomy; postoperative pain; procedures; spinal anesthesia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; Analgesics; Anesthesia, Spinal; Bupivacaine; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Male; Middle Aged; Morphine; Ovariectomy; Pain, Postoperative; Pregabalin; Young Adult",Article

Information regarding the conversion dose among Asian kidney transplant recipients is still limited. Objective This study aimed to compare the trough levels (Cmin) of TAC-BID (Prograf®) and TAC-OD (Advagraf®). The values were obtained from early conversion intervention by 1:1 milligram per-milligram. Setting A university-based hospital. Method This study employed a single-center, open-label, prospective and single-armed design. Fifteen de novo standard risk kidney transplant recipients were enrolled. Fourteen days after transplantation, the Cmin of TAC-BID (pre-conversion Cmin) was determined. Subsequently, TAC-BID was converted to TAC-OD with a similar dose. The Cmin of TAC-OD was first measured at a steady state (immediate post-conversion Cmin) and compared. All enrolled patients received therapeutic monitoring at the first and second months. Main outcome measure Pre-conversion Cmin of TAC-BID and immediate post-conversion Cmin of TAC-OD. Results The immediate post-conversion Cmin was found to be 23% lowered than the pre-conversion Cmin. However, the Cmin of TAC-OD was found to be similar to the pre-conversion Cmin compared during the follow-up period. Renal function was found to be stable in all patients over 2 months. Conclusion Early conversion therapy was associated with a significantly lower immediate post-conversion Cmin but comparable Cmin throughout the follow-up period.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is used as a monomer and plasticizer in the production of packaging materials. BPA enters canned or bottled drinks through the liquid being in contact with BPA-containing material (e.g., the plastic bottle or resin can-lining). Exposure to BPA in drinks may lead to health problems. The aim of this study was to determine BPA concentrations in canned carbonated drinks and plastic-bottled water available in Thailand and to determine whether exposure to sunlight increases BPA concentrations in plastic-bottled water. Samples of ten brands of canned carbonated drinks, 21 brands of plastic-bottled regular water, and six brands of plastic-bottled mineral water were purchased from supermarkets in Thailand. The samples were selected at random. Plastic-bottled water samples were exposed to sunlight for 10, 20, or 30 days. The BPA concentrations in the samples were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The limits of detection and quantitation for BPA were 30 and 70 ng/L, respectively. Two canned carbonated drink samples contained BPA concentrations below the limit of quantitation. The BPA concentrations in the other canned carbonated drinks were 83–340 ng/L. The BPA concentrations in all the bottled regular and mineral water samples that had been stored indoors were below the limit of detection. The BPA concentrations in the bottled regular and mineral water samples that had been exposed to sunlight remained below the limit of detection. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Bisphenol A; Canned carbonated drink; Plastic-bottled water; Polyethylene terephthalate,chemical compound; concentration (composition); drinking water; indoor air; phenotypic plasticity; polymer; solar radiation; supermarket; water availability; Thailand,Article

Prior evidence has linked cigarette tax increases to compensatory behaviours aimed at lowering the cost of smoking, such as switching to lower-priced cigarette brands. Using data from 2009 and 2011 Global Adult Tobacco Surveys in Thailand, we estimated unadjusted changes in cigarette prices paid, cigarette affordability, and consumption of cigarettes in three price categories classified as upper-, middle-, and lower-priced brand tiers (or price tertiles). We used ordered logit regression to analyse the correlates of price-tier choice and to estimate the change in price-tier consumption adjusted for demographic and region characteristics. Between 2009 and 2011, real cigarette prices increased, but the affordability of cigarettes remained unchanged overall. There was a significant reduction in the consumption of cigarette brands in the top price-tier overall, accompanied by increases in the consumption of brands in the bottom and middle price-tiers, depending on the region. Adjusted estimates from the logit models indicate that, on average, the proportion of smokers selecting brands from upper- and middle price-tiers decreased while consumption of lower price-tier brands increased during the study period. The estimated shifts in consumption from more expensive to less expensive cigarette brands and the overall lack of change in cigarette affordability in Thailand between 2009 and 2011 are both factors that may have contributed to the observed lack of change in smoking rates after the 2009 tax increase. © 2017",Cigarette affordability; Cigarette brand-switching; Cigarette price-tier; Cigarette prices; Global Adult Tobacco Surveys; Thailand; Tobacco tax,Article; compensation; controlled study; demography; female; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; marketing; policy; priority journal; smoking; smoking cessation; tax; Thailand,Article

The first is to determine the reinforcement of high performance short aramid fiber in two representative rubber matrices, namely natural rubber and acrylonitrile rubber. The second is to ascertain the effect of rubber polarity on the reinforcement. The third is to establish a pattern of reinforcement for use with less studied fibers. The rubbers were reinforced either with only aramid fiber or with a hybrid of aramid fiber and carbon black. The fiber contents were varied at 0, 2, 5 and 10 parts (by weight) per hundred rubber (phr) while those of carbon black were 0, 10, 20 and 30 phr. Conventional sulfur vulcanization was used. It was found that aramid fiber can reinforce both rubbers in the low strain region effectively, although to a significantly different degree. The hybrid carbon black provides additional reinforcement at low to medium strains and allows high strain stress upturn to occur in both rubber matrices. The findings enable the preparation of rubber composites having a wide, controllable range of mechanical behavior for specific high-performance engineering applications. Significantly, they also serve as a benchmark for developing reinforced systems from alternative fibers, particularly those from natural sources. © 2017",Acrylonitrile rubber; Aramid fiber; Hybrid composite; Natural rubber; Reinforced rubber,Carbon black; Fibers; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Rubber; Rubber applications; Strain; Textile fibers; Comparative studies; Controllable ranges; Hybrid composites; Mechanical behavior; Performance engineering; Reinforced rubber; Rubber composite; Sulfur vulcanization; Aramid fibers,Article

Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted in women scheduled to undergo elective gynecologic surgery. Various surgery-related data were collected, including blood request data and actual blood use. Incidence of blood transfusion and other indices were estimated, including crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio (C/T ratio), transfusion index (TI), and transfusion probability (%T). Results: Two hundred and sixty women with a mean age of 48.5 ± 11.0 years were included. A majority of cases (42.7%) had benign uterine pathology, and 27.3% of cases had gynecologic malignancies. Blood requests were type and screen in 60.8% of cases. Almost half of all operations were performed by staff members (46.9%), and hysterectomy was the most common procedure (62.3%). The overall rate of blood use was 11.5%. The rate was 5.1% among type and screen cases, and 21.6% in crossmatching cases. Blood use was significantly more common among gynecologic malignancy operations than other procedures. Overall, the C/T ratio was 4.27, the TI was 0.23, and the %T was 23%, indicating over-ordering of blood. Inappropriate blood ordering was observed for patients with uterine pathology and gynecologic malignancies, for patients operated on by a fellow or staff member, and for patients undergoing hysterectomy with/without adnexal surgery or oncologic procedures. Conclusions: The rate of blood use was 11.5% in elective abdominal gynecologic surgery. Various indices showed that blood ordering and utilization is still inefficient and needs some improvements.

Sleep disturbances (obstructive sleep apnea, insufficient or poor sleep quality) have been shown to adversely affect glucose metabolism. This study aimed to explore the relationship between sleep and glucagon-like peptide 1 regulation in patients with abnormal glucose tolerance. Seventy-one adults with haemoglobin A1c levels between 5.7% and < 6.5% and no history of diabetes participated. Habitual sleep duration and efficiency were obtained from 7-day actigraphy recordings. Obstructive sleep apnea was assessed using an overnight home monitor. Glucagon-like peptide 1 levels were measured during a 75-g glucose tolerance. The area under the curve of glucagon-like peptide 1 was calculated. The mean age (SD) was 55.1 (8.3) years and median (interquartile range) haemoglobin A1c was 5.97% (5.86, 6.23). There was no relationship between sleep duration or efficiency and fasting or area under the curve glucagon-like peptide 1. Glucagon-like peptide 1 levels did not differ among those sleeping ≤ 5.75, > 5.75–< 6.5 or ≥ 6.5 h per night. Increasing apnea–hypopnea index, an indicator of obstructive sleep apnea severity, correlated with lower area under the curve glucagon-like peptide 1 (B −0.242, P = 0.045), but not with fasting glucagon-like peptide 1 (B −0.213, P = 0.079). After adjusting for sex, haemoglobin A1c and body mass index, increasing apnea–hypopnea index was negatively associated with having area under the curve glucagon-like peptide 1 in the highest quartile (odds ratio 0.581, P = 0.028, 95% CI 0.359, 0.942). This study demonstrated that increasing obstructive sleep apnea severity was associated with lower glucagon-like peptide 1 response to glucose challenge. This could possibly be an additional mechanism by which obstructive sleep apnea affects glucose metabolism. Whether raising glucagon-like peptide 1 levels in patients with abnormal glucose tolerance with more severe obstructive sleep apnea will be beneficial should be explored. © 2017 The Authors.

In this study, we found no significant differences in short-term functional recovery between femoral neck fracture patients who received bisphosphonate treatment at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. Introduction: Bisphosphonate is the mainstay therapy for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate initiation on short-term functional recovery in femoral neck fracture patients at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. Methods: One hundred patients were randomly allocated into two groups in a parallel group designed, randomized, controlled trial. Both groups received risedronate 35 mg/week at either 2 or 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. All patients received calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Functional recovery was assessed by de Morton Mobility Index, Barthel Index, EuroQol 5D, visual analog scale, 2-min walk test, and timed get-up-and-go test at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Results: At the 3-month follow-up, all functional outcome measures showed significant improvement in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the functional outcomes between groups at both the 3-month and 1-year follow-ups. Although patients who received bisphosphonate initiation at week 2 had lower serum calcium level at 3 months and more overall adverse events than patients in the week 12 group, no patients in either group discontinued their prescribed medications. Conclusions: While underpowered, the findings of this study suggest that there were no significant differences in short-term functional recovery or significant adverse events between the two bisphosphonate groups. Thus, the initiation of bisphosphonate therapy may be considered as early as 2 weeks after femoral neck fracture. It is important that low serum calcium and vitamin D status must be corrected with calcium and vitamin D supplementation prior to or at the time of bisphosphonate initiation.

Recent findings Thailand is an example of a developing country with limited resources and low geneticist-To-population ratio. The country formally followed decentralized healthcare system (even though practically centralized) and is a nation with growing public interest in medical genetic technology. Nonetheless, efforts have been and are still being made in expanding clinical genetics services, improving access to laboratory diagnosis, increasing rare disease medication in national formulary, and the training of medical genetics personnel. For an endemic genetic disorder such as thalassemia, a universal prevention and control program is available and has had some success. Summary Lesson learned in country like Thailand may be a useful model for other developing nations. Several strategies can be attempted to integrate the advances in medical genetics into medical practices in developing countries with relatively low income per capita and geographic discrepancy in healthcare distribution.

Methods: A prospective randomized comparative study of critically ill children who required invasive monitoring in a tertiary referral center was conducted. All patients were randomized by a stratified block of 4 to either ultrasound-guided or traditional palpation radial artery cannulation. The primary outcomes were the first attempt and total success rates. Results: Eighty-four children were enrolled, with 43 randomized to the palpation technique and 41 to the ultrasound-guided technique. Demographic data between the groups were not significantly different. The total success and first attempt rates for the ultrasound-guided group were significantly higher than those for the palpation group (success ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.64; P =.018; and success ratio, 4.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-11.14; P =.004, respectively). The median time to success for the ultrasound-guided group was significantly shorter than that for the palpation group (3.3 versus 10.4 minutes; P <.001). Cannulation complications were lower in the ultrasound-guided group than the palpation group (12.5% versus 53.3%; P <.001).

Methods The anti-PfDBLα IgG and their IgG subclass distributions in plasma of severe (SM) and uncomplicated malaria (UCM) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. The antibody profiles to P. falciparum blood stage antigens were evaluated. CD36 binding ability was determined by static receptor-binding assays. Rosette formation was performed by staining with acridine orange. Results Significantly higher number of UCM (86.48%) than SM (57.78%) plasma contained total acquisition of specific IgG to P. falciparum antigens (P = 0.000). Similar manners were seen in response to P. falciparum DBLα with significant difference (UCM, 59.46% vs SM, 40.00%; P = 0.014). Anti-PfDBLα-IgG1 and -IgG3 were the predominant subclasses. Similar percentage of UCM (31.82%) and SM (33.33%) plasma contained only IgG1, while 13.64% of UCM and 27.78% of SM plasma contained only IgG3. Anti-PfDBLα-IgG1 coexpressed with more than one subclass was noted (UCM, 27.27%; SM, 16.67%). Obviously, IgG1 coexpressed with IgG3 (9.09%) was observed in only UCM plasma. IgG1 was coexpressed with IgG2 in UCM (9.09%) and SM (11.11%) plasma, while IgG1 was coexpressed with IgG4 only in UCM plasma (4.55%). IgG subclasses to P. falciparum antigens were distributed in a similar manner. Only the levels of IgG1, but not IgG3 were significantly higher in UCM than in SM. Conclusions These data suggest that individuals infected with P. falciparum can develop the anti-PfEMP1 antibodies with the major contribution of specific IgG subclasses. The balance and the levels of anti-PfDBLα IgG subclasses play a crucial role in antibody mediated protection against severe malaria. © 2017 Hainan Medical University",Antibody; PfEMP1-DBLα; Plasmodium falciparum; Severe malaria; Uncomplicated malaria,CD36 antigen; erythrocyte membrane protein 1; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G1; immunoglobulin G3; immunoglobulin G4; protein antibody; adaptive immunity; antibody response; antigen binding; antigen detection; antigen expression; Article; controlled study; disease severity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; immunoregulation; major clinical study; malaria falciparum; nonhuman; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; receptor binding assay; staining,Article

To clarify the mechanisms involved and facilitate the investigation of therapeutics, we previously developed a detection method for lipid-derived radicals using the fluorescent probe 2,2,6-trimethyl-6-pentyl-4-(4-nitrobenzo[1,2,5]oxadiazol-7-ylamino)piperidine-1-oxyl (NBD-Pen). In this study, NBD-Pen was used to detect lipid-derived radicals in Ox-LDL from in vitro and in vivo samples using an iron overloaded mouse model. By following the timeline of lipid radical generation using this method, the iron overloaded mice could be successfully treated with the antioxidant Trolox, resulting in successful lowering of the plasma lipid peroxidation, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels. Furthermore, using a combination therapy of the chelating agent deferoxamine (DFX) and Trolox, liver injury and oxidative stress markers were also reduced in iron overloaded mice. The NBD-Pen method is highly sensitive as well as selective and is suitable for targeting minimally modified LDL compared with other existing methods. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Antioxidant; Iron overload; Lipid; Low-density lipoprotein; Radical; Thalassemia,"2,2,6 trimethyl 6 pentyl 4 (4 nitrobenzo[1,2,5]oxadiazol 7 ylamino)piperidine 1 oxyl; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; deferoxamine; fluorescent dye; low density lipoprotein; malonaldehyde; radical; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; trolox C; unclassified drug; analytic method; animal experiment; animal model; Article; concentration response; controlled study; covalent bond; dose response; drug effect; drug efficacy; enzyme inhibition; fluorescence; in vitro study; in vivo study; iron overload; lipid peroxidation; liver injury; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal",Article

Methods: The ACV-loaded BSA nanoparticles were prepared by desolvation method along with physicochemical characterization, cytotoxicity, as well as in vitro transcorneal permeation studies across HCE-T cell multilayers. Results: The nanoparticles appeared to be spherical in shape and nearly uniform in size of about 200 nm. The size of nanoparticles became smaller with decreasing BSA concentration, while the ratios of water to ethanol seemed not to affect the size. Increasing the amount of ethanol in desolvation process led to significant reduction of drug entrapment of nanoparticles with smaller size and more uniformity. The ACV-loaded BSA nanoparticles prepared were shown to have no cytotoxic effect on HCE-T cells used in permeation studies. The in vitro transcorneal permeation results revealed that ACV could permeate through the HCE-T cell multilayers significantly higher from BSA nanoparticles than from aqueous ACV solutions. Conclusion: The ACV-loaded BSA nanoparticles could be prepared by desolvation method without glutaraldehyde in the formulation. ACV could increasingly permeate through the multilayers of HCE-T cells from the ACV-loaded BSA nanoparticles. Therefore, the ACV-loaded BSA nanoparticles could be a highly potential ocular drug delivery system. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.",acyclovir; bovine serum albumin; nanoparticles; ocular drug delivery; transcorneal permeability,"aciclovir; bovine serum albumin; nanoparticle; aciclovir; antivirus agent; bovine serum albumin; nanoparticle; apparent permeability; Article; cell viability; controlled study; dispersity; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; HCE-T cell line; herpes simplex keratitis; human; human cell; in vitro study; particle size; physical chemistry; zeta potential; animal; chemistry; cornea epithelium; metabolism; solubility; Acyclovir; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Drug Delivery Systems; Epithelium, Corneal; Humans; Nanoparticles; Particle Size; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Solubility",Article

This multicenter, cross-sectional study primarily aimed to determine prevalence of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) detected by plain lateral abdominal radiograph, and secondarily aimed to assess predictive factors for AAC. Patients (N = 1500), aged 18–70 years, with CKD stages 3–5D for ≥3 months prior to evaluation, were enrolled at 24 study centers in Thailand; 54.3% were non-dialysis patients. The prevalence of AAC was 70.6% and 70.8% in non-dialysis and dialysis patients, respectively. Patient's advanced age and widening pulse pressure were identified as predictive factors for AAC ≥ 5 in non-dialysis patients, while patient's age, history of coronary heart disease or diabetes, longer dialysis vintage, and increasing corrected serum calcium or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were identified as such in dialysis patients. With additional regression having covariates in binary, corrected serum calcium ≥9.5 mg/dL gave an OR 1.974 (95% CI: 1.324–2.943) for AAC ≥ 5 among the dialysis patients. AAC in diabetes subgroup (N = 692) was additionally evaluated and found that it was prevalent at 84.7% with increased phosphorus as predictive factor (OR, 1.178; 95% CI: 1.032–1.344) and 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D as protective factor (OR, 0.983; 95% CI, 0.970–0.996). The prevalence of AAC in the Thai CKD population is lower than that reported in the literature, and yet the burden is prominent in patients coexisting with diabetes.

OBJECTIVE S: To evaluate the efficacy of a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) tuberculosis (TB) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the diagnosis of sputum smear-negative pulmonary TB (PTB) and the usefulness of a drug-resistant (DR) TB-PCR assay compared with standard drug susceptibility testing (DST). DESIGN: BALF samples from 918 patients with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) negative sputum smears who underwent bronchoscopy for diagnostic evaluations of pulmonary diseases were prospectively determined for specific genetic elements of TB using the AnyplexTM MTB/NTM Real-Time Detection kit. Positive TB-PCR samples were subsequently evaluated for DR-TB using the Anyplex II MTB/MDR Detection kit. RESULTS: A total of 224 patients were finally diagnosed with PTB. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the TB-PCR assay were respectively 38.8%, 100%, 100%, and 83.5%. The TB-PCR assay was more sensitive than culture (30.4%) and smear (6.7%). Of the 68 TB-positive culture samples, three cases with either isoniazid (INH) or rifampicin (RMP) resistance were detected by DST. The Anyplex II MTB/MDR assay provided similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The BALF TB-PCR assay is a useful tool in the diagnosis of sputum smear-negative PTB. It can also provide INH and RMP susceptibility patterns similar to those of standard DST. © 2017 The Union.",Bronchoalveolar lavage; Drug-resistant TB; Non-tuberculous mycobacteria; Polymerase chain reaction; Tuberculosis,isoniazid; rifampicin; acid fast bacterium; adult; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterium culture; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; bronchoscopy; diagnostic test accuracy study; drug efficacy; drug resistant tuberculosis; female; gene sequence; human; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; sensitivity and specificity; sputum smear; Thailand,Article

Here, we investigated the effects of lupeol and stigmasterol on tumor and endothelial cells in vitro and their anti-cancer activities in vivo. Our results demonstrated that lupeol and stigmasterol suppressed cell viability, migration, and morphogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) but not cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells. Expression analyses showed that the treatment of both compounds significantly reduced the transcript level of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and Western blot analyses further revealed a decrease in downstream effector levels of VEGFR-2 signaling, including phosphorylated forms of Src, Akt, PCL, and FAK, which were rescued by TNF-a treatment. In vivo, lupeol and stigmasterol disrupted tumor angiogenesis and reduced the growth of CCA tumor xenografts. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed a decrease in CD31-positive vessel content and macrophage recruitment upon treatment. These findings indicate that lupeol and stigmasterol effectively target tumor endothelial cells and suppress CCA tumor growth by their anti-inflammatory activities and are attractive candidates for anticancer treatment of CCA tumors. © 2017 Kangsamaksin et al.

The dorsal root entry zone lesioning procedure (DREZotomy) is a modality used to treat intractable pain caused by insults to neural structures. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of and the factors that determine the outcome of microsurgical DREZotomy (MDT). Method: All consecutive patients who underwent MDT for treatment of intractable pain during September 2008 to December 2016 were enrolled. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Results: The 40 included patients underwent MDT for relief of intractable pain caused by 27 brachial plexus injuries (BPIs), 6 spinal cord injuries, 3 neoplasms, and 4 other causes. A significant reduction in pain was observed post-MDT for both average (p < 0.001) and maximal pain (p < 0.001). Favorable outcome (≥50% pain reduction) was observed in 67.5% of patients, with the best outcome in BPI-related pain. In multivariate analysis, injury of the spinal nerve root (root avulsion or injury) was significantly associated with good average pain relief (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.2–27.5; p = 0.026) and pain freedom (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.12–22.30; p = 0.035). Electrical pain (OR, 6.49; 95% CI, 1.20–35.19; p = 0.030) and lower number of painful dermatomes (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01–1.67; p = 0.039) were significantly associated with good maximal pain relief. Conclusions: MDT is an effective procedure for treatment of intractable pain in well-selected patients, particularly in cases with brachial plexus avulsion pain. Injury of the spinal nerve root (brachial plexus avulsion and cauda equina injury) was associated with good average pain relief and pain freedom, and electrical pain and lower number of painful dermatomes were associated with good maximal pain relief.

This work describes the development and utilization of an effective protocol to analyze and extract phenolic acids from POME. p-Coumaric acid (CMA) and caffeic acid (CFA) were identified as major constituents. We therefore developed a protocol to synthesize 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid (3,4,5-THCA), a strong antioxidant with potential use as a medicinal agent, based on the biocatalytic reaction of p-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase (HPAH) with CMA as a substrate. The reaction showed greater efficiency than previous protocols in terms of cost (1/10 reduction), scale (40–50 fold increase) and production time (1/3 reduction).

We investigated the environmental factors influencing tree abundance and regeneration in diverse forest types growing in the riparian area of an urbanizing landscape along the Chao Phraya River. We established 252 0.1-ha circular plots in remnant forest patches along 372 km of the river. Cluster analysis was applied to classify the forest types. The relationships between environmental variables and tree abundance were assessed with ordination analysis, and generalized linear models were used to assess seedling/sapling abundance. The cluster analysis revealed five forest types, including floodplain forest with three sub-forest types, swamp forest, and mangrove forest. The ordination indicated that tree abundance in the floodplain forest was positively affected by distance to the ocean and the proportion of forested area. Swamp forest was positively influenced by the proportion of urbanized area and mean rainfall. Mangrove forest was negatively related to distance to the river. Seedling/sapling abundance of the dominant species in the floodplain forests was positively affected by lowland plain topography and negatively affected by the proportion of urbanized area, whereas swamp and mangrove forest species were positively influenced by the proportion of urbanized area and estuarine topography. Mature tree density influenced seedling/sapling abundance of all forest types. Tree abundance and regeneration of the riparian landscape was prevented by the urbanized area, floodplain, estuarine topography, and mature tree densities in remnant forests. These results suggest that remnant forest patches of conserved riparian forests along the urbanized landscape of the Chao Phraya River must be protected and the factors determining their colonization must be considered to enhance restoration practices. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Classification; Ordination; Regeneration; Remnant forest; Tropical,colonization; floodplain forest; mangrove; ordination; plant community; regeneration; riparian zone; species conservation; swamp forest; vegetation cover; woody plant; Chao Phraya River; Thailand,Article

In this work, we examine the effectiveness of using low frequency, high intensity ultrasound to promote the spatial penetration of drug molecules away from the implant/injection site boundary upon release from injectable, phase inverting poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) implants. Fluorescein-loaded PLGA solutions were injected into poly(acrylamide) phantoms, and the constructs were treated daily for 14 days with ultrasound at 2.2 W/cm2 for 10 min. The 2D distribution of fluorescein within the phantoms was quantified using fluorescence imaging. Implants receiving ultrasound irradiation showed a 1.7–5.6 fold increase (p &lt; 0.05) in fluorescence intensity and penetration distance, with the maximum increase observed 5 days post-implantation. However, this evidence was not seen when the same experiment was also carried out in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4). Results suggest an active role of ultrasound in local molecular transport in the phantom. An increase of fluorescein release and penetration depth in phantoms can be accomplished through brief application of ultrasound.

The purpose of this study was to establish a normogram of renal cortical elasticity values and assess their variation between right and left kidney and their relation with age, gender, body mass index, renal dimensions and skin to cortex distance. Methods The study was a hospital based cross sectional study performed at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, a tertiary care center in Kathmandu, Nepal. All individuals referred for Ultrasound from General Health Check up clinic were included in the study. Patient with abnormal ultrasound findings and abnormal renal function test were excluded from the study. Renal morphometry including length, cortical thickness, and skin to cortex distance were measured in B mode imaging and renal cortical elastography was measured with region of interest box of 1 × 0.5 cm. All analyses were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 20.0 soft ware. Results A total of 95 individuals who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The mean values of right and left renal cortical shear wave velocity were 1.49 ± 0.19 m/s and 1.54 ± 0.19 m/s respectively. Statistical significant difference was observed between the renal cortical shear wave velocity of right and left kidney. The renal shear wave velocity was seen to decrease with age, however the correlation was not statistically significant. No significant difference was also noted in renal shear wave velocity among various sex or Body mass index groups. Statistically significant negative correlation was noted between skin to cortex distance and renal cortical shear wave velocities. However no statistically significant correlation was noted between renal dimensions and renal cortical shear wave velocities. Conclusions The normal cortical elasticity values in terms of shear wave velocity of right and left kidney were established. Renal elasticity is independent of the age, gender, Body mass index and renal dimensions. © 2017",Renal elastography; Shear wave elastography; Ultrasound,adult; age distribution; aged; Article; B scan; body mass; cross-sectional study; elasticity; elastography; female; human; kidney cortex; major clinical study; male; middle aged; morphometry; normal value; obesity; renal cortical elastography; shear wave elastography; thickness; velocity,Article

We hypothesized that nesting success would be higher in nest cavities with more concealed entrances and therefore more likely chosen over less concealed cavities. We set 200 nest boxes in ∼100 territories of White-rumped Shamas (Copsychus malabaricus), territorial cavity nesters, in a seasonal evergreen forest in northeastern Thailand. Shamas were provided two boxes per territory, one with high and the other with low vegetation cover in front of the box entrance. Boxes were reset in new locations after a nest fledged or failed, providing 170 'choice' trials. We also compared vegetation characteristics of natural nest cavities with available natural nest cavities. Contrary to predictions, shamas placed nest material in the less concealed boxes significantly more often (89 boxes vs. 48), were significantly more likely to lay eggs in less concealed boxes (66 vs. 27), and eggs were significantly more likely to hatch in the low concealment treatment (38 vs. 8). Nest survival in the low concealment treatment was approximately twice that of the highly concealed boxes 36% (± 0.035) vs. 18% (± 0.042). Vegetation around natural nests (n = 26) was not significantly different from available randomly selected cavities (n = 52). Both used and available cavities had low levels of concealment. Cavity-nesting species may prefer less concealed sites because it is easier for an incubating/brooding female to detect approaching predators, allowing additional time for escaping and/or for mounting a defense. © 2017 Wilson Ornithological Society.

In the absence of information on malaria vector transmission dynamics, this study aimed to identify the anopheline vectors and their role in malaria transmission. Adult female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected monthly by human-landing catch in Na Chaluai District of Ubon Ratchathani Province during January 2014−December 2015. Field-captured mosquitoes were identified to species using morphology-based keys and molecular assays (allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, AS-PCR), and analysed for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of circumsporozoite proteins (CSP). A total of 1,229 Anopheles females belonging to 13 species were collected. Four anopheline taxa were most abundant: Members of the Anopheles barbirostris complex, comprising 38% of the specimens, species of the Anopheles hyrcanus group (18%), Anopheles nivipes (17%) and Anopheles philippinensis (12%). The other nine species comprised 15% of the collections. Plasmodium infections were detected in two of 668 pooled samples of heads/thoraces, Anopheles dirus (1/29) and An. philippinensis (1/97). The An. dirus pool had a mixed infection of P. vivax-210 and P. vivax-247, whereas the An. philippinensis pool was positive only for the latter protein variant. Both positive ELISA samples were confirmed by nested PCR. This study is the first to incriminate An. dirus and An. philippinensis as natural malaria vectors in the area where the outbreak occurred.

Hoechst 33342 staining was conducted to confirm the detection of cell apoptosis. Caspase-3 and caspase-8 mRNA and cleaved protein levels were investigated by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were determined by ELISA.RESULTS: Caspase-3 and caspase-8 specific inhibitors suppressed HCT-induced cell death. HCT increased caspase-3 and caspase-8 mRNA, protein levels, and caspase activities in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. HCT induced MAPK phosphorylation in a time-dependent fashion. Pretreatment of cells with a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK reduced apoptosis and reversed the levels of HMGB1 release in response to HCT treatment.CONCLUSION: HCT induces A375 programmed cell death by activating the caspase-dependent pathway and by p38 phosphorylation associated with HMGB1 reduction.

During loading of guns, the handler touches the CBCs and hence they can be a valuable source of touch DNA. Previous studies on development of STR profiles from CBCs resulted in very low success rates. Direct PCR has shown increased success rates with low-level DNA but has not been applied to STR typing from casings. Here, we quantified the effect of firing on DNA quantity and also evaluated direct PCR as an alternative method to STR typing from bullet casings. Buffy coat was deposited on 9 mm bullets and DNA was extracted from the casings of fired and unfired bullets (N = 30 each). Firing the bullets decreased the amount of DNA recovered by around 30%. For comparison of STR typing protocols, ten volunteers touched three ammunition types (9 mm, 5.56 mm, and 7.62 mm; N = 60 bullets). Casings were swabbed with EO swab moistened with PBS. Total DNA obtained from fired casings were 207 ± 523 pg. In terms of the number of alleles typed, the direct PCR protocol did not differ statistically from the conventional extraction-STR typing protocol (95% Bayesian credible intervals of 3.0–7.8 and 3.9–10.3 alleles, respectively). This study showed that direct PCR can be used as an alternative method for STR typing from bullet casings. As the direct PCR protocol is quicker and cheaper than the conventional protocol, forensic DNA laboratories may benefit from using direct PCR for bullet casings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bullet casings; Direct PCR; Touch DNA,DNA; gunpowder; metal ion; allele; Article; Bayes theorem; bullet; bullet casing; clinical evaluation; clinical laboratory; clinical protocol; comparative study; controlled study; DNA determination; DNA extraction; human; limit of quantitation; normal human; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; short tandem repeat; touch,Article

Vitamin D has been proposed as an associated factor in CWP. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in the management of CWP. A comprehensive search of the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was performed from inception through January 2017. The inclusion criterion was the randomized clinical trials’ evaluating the effects of vitamin D treatment in adult subjects with CWP or FMS. CWP was defined as chronic recurrent musculoskeletal pain without secondary causes; FMS patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FMS. Study outcome was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) of pain intensity. Pooled mean difference (MD) of VAS and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect meta-analysis. Meta-regression analysis using a random-effects model was performed to explore the effects of change in vitamin D in the treatment group on difference in the mean of VAS. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the robustness of results. The between-study heterogeneity of effect size was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Data were extracted from four randomized controlled trials involving 287 subjects. Pooled result demonstrated a significantly lower VAS in CWP patients who received vitamin D treatment compared with those who received placebo (MD = 0.46; 95% CI 0.09–0.89, I2 = 48%). Meta-regression analysis revealed no significant relationship between the changes of vitamin D and VAS (coefficient = 0.04 (95% CI −0.01 to 0.08), p = 0.10). In this meta-analysis, we conclude that vitamin D supplementation is able to decrease pain scores and improve pain despite no significant change in VAS after increasing serum vitamin D level. Further studies need to be conducted in order to explore the improvement of functional status, quality of life, and the pathophysiological change that improves chronic widespread pain. © 2017, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).",Cholecalciferol; Chronic widespread pain; Ergocalciferol; Fibromyalgia; Meta-analysis; Vitamin D,placebo; vitamin D; Article; chronic non specific widespread pain; chronic pain; clinical research; confidence interval; effect size; fibromyalgia; human; medical society; meta analysis; musculoskeletal pain; outcome assessment; pain intensity; priority journal; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; therapy effect; visual analog scale; vitamin supplementation,Article

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing patients with apical prolapse (POP-Q point C ≥ −1) who underwent Elevate™ mesh repair (n = 146) with patients who underwent laparoscopic sacral colpopexy (n = 267). Results: The sacral colpopexy group had a mean age of 59 years and a BMI of 25.7. Patients in the Elevate™ group were older, with a mean age of 63 and a BMI of 26.3. Most of the patients of both groups presented with pelvic organ prolapse stage III (LSC 73.8% and Elevate™ 87.0%) and their mean POP-Q point C were not significantly different (LSC 1.4 vs Elevate™ 1.2 cm). Operative time was longer in the LSC group (113 vs 91 min, p &lt; 0.001), but estimated blood loss was lower (75 cm3 vs 137 cm3, p &lt; 0.001). No difference in mesh exposure rate could be found between the two groups at one year (Elevate™ 0.7% vs LSC 2.6%, OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.10, p = 0.21). One-year objective cure rate, defined as no descent beyond the hymen, was 97.0% in the LSC group and 96.6% in the Elevate™ group (p = .81). The overall recurrence (objective, subjective recurrence or reoperation) was also not different between the groups (LSC 4.5% vs Elevate 4.8%, p = 0.89).

V. cinerea bioactive compounds, including flavonoids and hirsutinolide-type sesquiterpene lactones, have shown an inhibition effect on the nicotine-metabolizing cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) enzyme and hirsutinolides reported suppressing cancer growth. In this study, V. cinerea ethanol extract and its bioactive compounds, including four flavonoids and four hirsutinolides, were investigated for an inhibitory effect on human liver microsomal CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 using cocktail inhibition assays combined with LC-MS/MS analysis. Among tested flavonoids, chrysoeriol was more potent in inhibition on CYP2A6 and CYP1A2 than other liver CYPs, with better binding efficiency toward CYP2A6 than CYP1A2 (Ki values in competitive mode of 1.93 ± 0.05 versus 3.39 ± 0.21 μM, respectively). Hirsutinolides were prominent inhibitors of CYP2A6 and CYP2D6, with IC50 values of 12–23 and 15–41 μM, respectively. These hirsutinolides demonstrated time-dependent inhibition, an indication of mechanism-based inactivation, toward CYP2A6. Quantitative prediction of microsomal metabolism of these flavonoids and hirsutinolides, including half-lives and hepatic clearance rate, was examined.

Most of the synthesized bis-thioureas, except for analogs 8–11, displayed cytotoxicity against MOLT-3 cell line (IC50 = 1.55–32.32 µM). Derivatives 5, 14, 18 and 19 showed a broad spectrum of anticancer activity. Analogs (4, 5, 8, 13, 14, 18 and 19) exhibited higher inhibitory efficacy in HepG2 cells than the control drug, etoposide. Significantly, bis-trifluoromethyl analog 19 was the promising potent cytotoxic agent (IC50 = 1.50–18.82 µM) with the best safety index (1.64–20.60). Antimalarial activity results showed that trifluoromethyl derivative 18 was the most potent compound (IC50 = 1.92 µM, selective index = 6.86). Antimicrobial activity revealed that bis-thioureas 12, 18 and 19 exhibited selective activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Promisingly, the bis-trifluoromethyl derivative 19 was the most potent compound in the series and displayed higher potency, against most of the Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, than that of ampicillin, the reference drug. Among the tested strains of microorganisms, compound 19 inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 with the lowest MIC of 1.47 µM.

Patients and Methods A cohort of all residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, first diagnosed with sarcoidosis between January 1, 1976, and December 31, 2013, was identified through the medical record linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Diagnosis was verified by individual medical record review. A cohort of sex- and age-matched comparators without sarcoidosis was assembled from the same population. Data on 18 chronic conditions recommended by the US Department of Health and Human Services for both cases and comparators were retrieved and compared. Results The prevalence of multimorbidity (ie, the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions) was similar between the 2 groups: 111 of 345 cases (32.2%) and 110 of 345 comparators (31.9%) (P=.99). After the index date, 156 cases (43.8%) and 142 comparators (41.2%) developed multimorbidity, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.60 (95% CI, 1.27-2.01; P<.001). The cumulative incidence of the presence of ≥3, 4, and 5 chronic conditions was also consistently significantly higher in cases than in comparators (P value=.01,.004 and.002, respectively). Analysis by specific type of chronic condition revealed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke or transient ischemic attack, arthritis, depression, diabetes, and major osteoporotic fracture.

The association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and hepatic encephalopathy has been shown in many epidemiologic studies. This meta-analysis was conducted to summarize all available studies to estimate the association between H. pylori infection and hepatic encephalopathy. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE database through March 2017 to identify studies that reported the association between H. pylori infection and hepatic encephalopathy. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Of 15,233 studies, eleven studies (four cross-sectional, four case–control, and three cohort studies) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with H. pylori infection was 1.73 (95% CI 1.09–2.73) when compared with the patients without H. pylori infection. The association between H. pylori and hepatic encephalopathy was not statistically significant after the sensitivity analysis, excluding those using ELISA alone, with a pooled OR of 1.92 (95% CI 0.91–4.05, I2 = 62%). There was no publication bias of overall included studies assessed by the funnel plots and Egger’s regression asymmetry test. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a potential association between H. pylori infection and risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Future studies are required to assess the effect of chronicity of infection on the development of hepatic encephalopathy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Campylobacter; Delirium; Helicobacter; Hepatic encephalopathy; Meta-analysis,Article; disease association; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Helicobacter infection; hepatic encephalopathy; human; nonhuman; priority journal; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; complication; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; hepatic encephalopathy; meta analysis; microbiology; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Hepatic Encephalopathy; Humans,Article

Visual deterrents have been used successfully to control animal pests, in some cases in an effort to replace pesticide use. Despite evidence that visual signals are crucial in site choice for egg deposition by dengue vectors, and that female mosquitoes respond to artificial predation, the role of predator intimidation as it affects the oviposition behavior of dengue vectors remains largely unexplored. Here, we examined the oviposition responses of Aedes aegypti exposed to various mosquito predator pictures. Gravid females were presented with equal opportunities to oviposit in two cups with predator images [Toxorhynchites splendens—TXI, Goldfish (Carassius auratus)—small (SFI) and large (LFI) and Tx. splendens + Goldfish—TXFI] and two others without pictures. Differences in egg deposition were examined between sites with and without these images. When given a chance to oviposit in cups with and without TXI, Ae. aegypti females were similarly attracted to both sites. When provided an opportunity to oviposit in cups displaying pictures of fish (SFI or LFI) and blank cups, egg deposition rates were much lower in the fish picture sites. Females showed a preference for blank cups over TXFI for egg deposition. They also equally avoided cups with pictures of fish, regardless of the size of the picture. Our results indicate that the presence of images of goldfish and their association with Tx. larvae significantly reduced egg deposition by Ae. aegypti, and this was not the case with the predatory larvae alone. The observations that the images of natural predators can repel gravid females of a dengue vector provide novel possibilities to develop effective and inexpensive alternative tools to harmful insecticides. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Aedes aegypti; Oviposition; Photo; Predator,"breeding site; dengue fever; disease control; image; mosquito; oviposition; predator; Aedes aegypti; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; dengue; egg laying; female; goldfish; mosquito; nonhuman; photography; predator prey interaction; predator stress; Toxorhynchites splendens; vector control; Aedes; animal; breeding; dengue; ecosystem; larva; mosquito vector; photostimulation; physiology; transmission; vision; Aedes aegypti; Animalia; Carassius auratus; Toxorhynchites; Aedes; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Breeding; Dengue; Ecosystem; Female; Goldfish; Larva; Mosquito Vectors; Oviposition; Photic Stimulation; Visual Perception",Article

Streptomyces avermitilis predominantly produces three polyketide antibiotics (avermectin, filipin, and oligomycin) but has the potential to produce more secondary metabolites based on the number of cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters. Here, we extensively investigated the metabolite profiles of a gene disruptant of AvaR3 (an autoregulator receptor homologue), which is involved in the pleiotropic regulation of antibiotic production and cell morphology. Unlike the wild-type strain, the avaR3 mutant accumulated compound 3 in the culture. The chemical structure of compound 3 was elucidated on the basis of various spectroscopic analyses, and was identified as phthoxazolin A, a cellulose synthesis inhibitor. Bioassays demonstrated that compound 3 exerts growth inhibitory activity against a broad range of plant pathogenic oomycetes. Moreover, unlike avermectin production, phthoxazolin A (3) production was negatively controlled by avenolide, a new type of autoregulator in streptomycetes, through the function of AvaR3. These results suggest that the genetic manipulation of autoregulator receptor homologues would be a valuable tool for the discovery of cryptic bioactive compounds. © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan",Autoregulator receptor; Avenolide; Cryptic secondary metabolites; Phthoxazolin A; Streptomyces avermitilis,Antibiotics; Bacteria; Biomolecules; Chemical analysis; Genes; Ketones; Spectroscopic analysis; Autoregulator receptor; Avenolide; Phthoxazolin A; Secondary metabolites; Streptomyces avermitilis; Metabolites; antibiotic agent; autoregulator receptor; avenolide; avermectin; hormone; phthoxazolin A; receptor; unclassified drug; antibiotic biosynthesis; antibiotic sensitivity; antifungal activity; Article; avaR3 gene; bacterial gene; controlled study; drug isolation; drug structure; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; Oomycetes; Phytophthora capsici; Phytophthora parasitica; regulatory mechanism; Streptomyces avermitilis; Biosynthesis; Genes,Article

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using MEDLINE Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. A bivariate meta-analysis was applied for pooling of diagnostic parameters. Six of the total 4719 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ, N = 604) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS, N = 420) were the most frequently used screening tools during pregnancy. The pooled prevalence of OSA during pregnancy was 26.7% (95%CI: 16.9%, 34.4%, I2 = 83.15%). BQ performance was poor to fair with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.45, 0.83; I2 = 78.65%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I2 = 81.55%), respectively. BQ performance was heterogeneous depending on type of reference test and pregnancy. Sensitivity increased if diagnosis was based on polysomnography (0.90), and respiratory disturbance index (0.90). However, sensitivity decreased if screening was performed in early pregnancy (≤20 weeks gestation: 0.47), and high-risk pregnancy (0.44).

To achieve this, predicting whether or not two metabolites are transformable is the first essential step. The problems of predicting the possibility of transforming one metabolite into another and how to computationally synthesize a metabolic pathway were studied. These two problems were transformed to the problem of classifying features of metabolite pairs into transformable or non-transformable classes. The following two main issues were contributed in this study: (1) two new feature schemes, i.e. the projected features on their first principal component and the average features, for representing transform-ability of each metabolite pair using 2D and 3D compound structural features and (2) a method of modified imbalanced data handling by adding synthetic boundary data of different classes to balance data. Based on the E. coli reference pathways, the results of proposed features with feature selection and our imbalanced data handling approach show the better performance than the results from other methods when evaluated by several metrics. Our significant feature group possibly achieves high classification correctness of computational pathway synthesis. In pathway recovery results by a group of neural network models, 19 pathways were significantly recovered by our feature group at each recovery ratio of at least 0.5, whereas the other compared feature group gave only four significantly recovered pathways. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Classification; Feature; Imbalanced data; Metabolite; Neural networks; Pathway,Biomolecules; Computer system recovery; Data handling; Escherichia coli; Forecasting; Metabolism; Metabolites; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Recovery; Feature; First principal components; Imbalanced data; Metabolic pathways; Neural classifiers; Neural network model; Pathway; Structural feature; Classification (of information),Article

We have previously shown that organisms lacking OxyR are rapidly killed by &lt;2 or 500 mM H2O2 in planktonic and biofilm bacteria, respectively. In this study, we first employed a bioinformatic approach to elucidate the potential regulatory breadth of OxyR by scanning the entire P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome for canonical OxyR promoter recognition sequences (ATAG-N7-CTAT-N7-ATAG-N7-CTAT). Of &gt;100 potential OxyR-controlled genes, 40 were strategically selected that were not predicted to be involved in the direct response to oxidative stress (e.g., catalase, peroxidase, etc.) and screened such genes by RT-PCR analysis for potentially positive or negative control by OxyR. Differences were found in 7 of 40 genes when comparing an oxyR mutant vs. PAO1 expression that was confirmed by ß-galactosidase reporter assays. Among these, phnW, encoding 2-aminoethylphosphonate:pyruvate aminotransferase, exhibited reduced expression in the oxyR mutant compared to wild-type bacteria. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated binding of OxyR to the phnW promoter and DNase I footprinting analysis also revealed the sequences to which OxyR bound. Interestingly, a phnW mutant was more susceptible to t-butyl-hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) treatment than wild-type bacteria. Although we were unable to define the direct mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we believe that this may be due to a reduced efficiency for this strain to degrade t-BOOH relative to wild-type organisms because of modulation of AHP gene transcription in the phnW mutant. © 2017 Panmanee et al.

In this study, the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the Opisthorchis viverrini CALR gene were analyzed, and calcium-binding and chaperoning properties of recombinant O. viverrini CALR (OvCALR) investigated. OvCALR mRNA was detected from the newly excysted juvenile to the mature parasite by RT-PCR while specific antibodies showed a wide distribution of the protein. OvCALR was localized in tegumental cell bodies, testes, ovary, eggs, Mehlis’ gland, prostate gland, and vitelline cells of the mature parasite. Recombinant OvCALR showed an in vitro suppressive effect on the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase. The recombinant OvCALR C-domain showed a mobility shift in native gel electrophoresis in the presence of calcium. The results imply that OvCALR has comparable function to the mammalian homolog as a calcium-binding molecular chaperone. Inferred from the observed strong immunostaining of the reproductive tissues, OvCALR should be important for reproduction and might be an interesting target to disrupt parasite fecundity.

Effects of macromolecule size and macromolecule hydrodynamic interaction with the nanostructure of the cellular layers of the glomerular capillary wall on the glomerular size selectivity are investigated through a mathematical simulation based on an ultrastructural model. The epithelial slit, a planar arrangement of fibers connecting the epithelial podocytes, is represented as a row of parallel cylinders with nonuniform spacing between adjacent fibers. The mean and standard deviation of gap half-width between its fibers are based on values recently reported from electron microscopy. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is represented as a fibrous medium containing fibers of two different sizes: the size of type IV collagens and that of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The endothelial cell layer is modeled as a layer full of fenestrae that are much larger than solute size and filled with GAGs. The calculated total sieving coefficient agrees well with the sieving coefficients of ficolls obtained from in vivo urinalysis in humans, whereas the computed glomerular hydraulic permeability also falls within the range estimated from human glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Our result indicates that the endothelial cell layer and GBM significantly contribute to solute and fluid restriction of the glomerular barrier, whereas, based on the structure of the epithelial slit obtained from electron microscopy, the contribution of the epithelial slit could be smaller than previously believed. © 2017 by ASME.",,Blood; Cardiovascular system; Cylinders (shapes); Electron microscopes; Electron microscopy; Endothelial cells; Macromolecules; Physiology; Glomerular basement membrane; Glomerular capillaries; Glomerular filtration; Glomerular filtration rate; Hydraulic permeability; Hydrodynamic interaction; Mathematical simulations; Mean and standard deviations; Fibers; collagen type 4; glycosaminoglycan; Article; collagen fiber; diffusion; electron microscopy; endothelium cell; glomerulus basement membrane; glomerulus capillary; glomerulus filtration; glomerulus filtration rate; human; hydraulic permeability; hydrodynamics; macromolecule; podocyte; urinalysis,Article

A complete sectoral analysis was performed to show how a low-carbon society (LCS) could be developed by adopting various countermeasures. Energy service demand and carbon mitigation policy plans for the BMA are presented. The Bilan Carbone model—scenario-based modeling—was used for the first time for such an application. Bilan Carbone functions through Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) which provides a systematic methodology for combining inputs with cost/benefit information and stakeholder views, to rank policy alternatives. The base year was 2015 and the target year 2050, for the mitigation potential scenario analysis. The results show that the CO2 emissions in the city will increase from 43 MtCO2e in 2015 to 149 MtCO2e in 2050. The largest potential for CO2 emission reduction is in the industrial sector (13%) and least potential is found in the “others” sector (4%), but these could all be achieved through energy-efficiency improvements. The BMA can be a low-carbon society by following the optimal solutions provided under the 2050 LCS scenario and can lower emissions by 50% compared to the 2050 BAU scenario. A carbon mitigation policy action framework was designed, with 9 policy action plans detailing all the low-carbon countermeasures and roadmaps to a low-carbon society. Such quantification at the city level may help policy makers in managing energy issues and implementation of climate-change mitigation strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bilan carbone model; Climate science; Decarbonization; Low carbon paths; MCDA; Mitigation action plans,Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Decarbonization; Decision making; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Action plan; Carbon mitigation policies; Climate change mitigation; Climate science; Energy efficiency improvements; Low carbon; MCDA; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Climate models,Article

Night-shift work, a form of circadian misalignment, is associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk. This study aimed to determine if night-shift workers with type 2 diabetes experience poorer glycaemic control than non-shift workers. Patients with type 2 diabetes (104 unemployed, 85 day workers and 60 night-shift workers) participated. Sleep duration, sleep quality, morningness–eveningness preference, depressive symptoms and dietary intake were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Haemoglobin A1c levels were measured. Night-shift workers had significantly higher haemoglobin A1c levels compared with others, while there were no differences between day workers and unemployed participants (median 7.86% versus 7.24% versus 7.09%, respectively). Additionally, night-shift workers were younger, had a higher body mass index, and consumed more daily calories than others. Among night-shift workers, there were no significant differences in haemoglobin A1c levels between those performing rotating versus non-rotating shifts (P = 0.856), or those with clockwise versus counterclockwise shift rotation (P = 0.833). After adjusting for age, body mass index, insulin use, sleep duration, morningness–eveningness preference and percentage of daily intake from carbohydrates, night-shift work, compared with day work, was associated with significantly higher haemoglobin A1c (B = 0.059, P = 0.044), while there were no differences between unemployed participants and day workers (B = 0.016, P = 0.572).

The structural and textural properties of the synthesized supports were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption–desorption, Raman spectroscopy, H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and H2-chemisorption. Upon addition of Pr, XRD patterns and Raman spectra indicated an enlargement of ceria unit cell and the characteristics Raman broad peak at 570 cm−1 which was attributed to the existence of oxygen vacancies in the ceria lattice. This indicated that some Ce4+ ions in ceria were replaced by larger Pr3+ cations. To evidence the incorporation of Pr3+ cations into ceria lattice, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) was employed. The results showed that the oxidation states of Ce in mixed oxide supports were slightly lower than 4+ while those of Pr were still the same as a precursor salt. Therefore, the incorporation of Pr3+ into ceria lattice would lead to strain and unbalanced charge and result in oxygen vacancies. The reducibility of Ce1−xPrxO2 mixed oxide supports was investigated by H2-TPR and temperature-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiment under reduction conditions. XANES spectra of Ce L3 edges showed a lower surface reduction temperature (Ce4+ to Ce3+) of Ce0.925Pr0.075O2 than that of CeO2 which agreed with H2-TPR results. H2-chemisorption indicated that Pr promoted the dispersion of the metal catalyst on the mixed oxide support and increased the adsorption site for CO. For WGS reaction, 1% Pd/mixed oxide support had higher WGS activity than 1% Pd/ceria. The increase of WGS activity was due to the increase of Pd dispersion on the support and the existence of oxygen vacancies produced from incorporation of Pr into the ceria lattice. © 2017 Chinese Society of Rare Earths",Ce1−xPrxO2 mixed oxide support; Oxygen vacancies; Temperature-resolved in-situ H2 reduction,Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Cerium compounds; Chemisorption; Dispersions; Oxygen; Palladium; Positive ions; Praseodymium; Praseodymium compounds; Precipitation (chemical); Temperature programmed desorption; Water gas shift; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; Coprecipitation method; H2 reduction; H2 temperature-programmed reduction; Mixed oxide; Reduction conditions; Surface reduction; Textural properties; X-ray absorption near-edge structure; Oxygen vacancies,Article

In this paper, we demonstrate their characteristics and benefits through synthetic examples using 1D and three-dimensional (3D) models. First, a model of the regional mean 1D conductivity profile is obtained using the average ssq impedance with different levels of galvanic distortion. In contrast to the Berdichevsky average using the average det impedance, the average ssq impedance is shown to yield a reliable estimate of the model of the regional mean 1D conductivity profile, even when severe galvanic distortion is contained in the data. Second, the local and regional distortion indicators were found to indicate the galvanic distortion as expressed by the splitting and shear parameters and to quantify their strengths in individual MT data and in the dataset as a whole. Third, the apparent gain was also shown to be a good approximation of the site gain, which is generally claimed to be undeterminable without external information. The model of the regional mean 1D profile could be used as an initial or a priori model in higher-dimensional inversions. The local and regional distortion indicators and apparent gains could be used to examine the existence and to guess the strength of the galvanic distortion. Although these conclusions were derived from synthetic tests using the Groom-Bailey distortion model, additional tests with different distortion models indicated that these conclusions are not strongly dependent on the choice of distortion model. These galvanic-distortion-related parameters would also assist in judging if a proper treatment is needed for the galvanic distortion when an MT dataset is given. Hence, this information derived from the dataset would be useful in MT data analysis and inversion.

Improving our understanding of how artemisinin-based drugs act and how resistance manifests is essential for the optimization of dosing regimens and the development of strategies to prolong the life span of current first-line treatment options. Recent short-drug-pulse in vitro experiments have shown that the parasite killing rate depends not only on drug concentration but also the exposure time, challenging the standard pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) paradigm in which the killing rate depends only on drug concentration. Here, we introduce a dynamic stress model of parasite killing and show through application to 3D7 laboratory strain viability data that the inclusion of a time-dependent parasite stress response dramatically improves the model’s explanatory power compared to that of a traditional PK-PD model. Our model demonstrates that the previously reported hypersensitivity of early-ring-stage parasites of the 3D7 strain to dihydroartemisinin compared to other parasite stages is due primarily to a faster development of stress rather than a higher maximum achievable killing rate. We also perform in vivo simulations using the dynamic stress model and demonstrate that the complex temporal features of artemisinin action observed in vitro have a significant impact on predictions for in vivo parasite clearance. Given the important role that PK-PD models play in the design of clinical trials for the evaluation of alternative drug dosing regimens, our novel model will contribute to the further development and improvement of antimalarial therapies. © 2017 Cao et al.",Artemisinin action; Drug exposure time; Dynamic model; Plasmodium falciparum,artesunate; dihydroartemisinin; antimalarial activity; antiprotozoal therapy; Article; concentration response; controlled study; drug blood level; drug efficacy; drug exposure; drug half life; dynamic stress model; explanatory variable; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; intermethod comparison; malaria falciparum; mathematical model; maximum plasma concentration; nonhuman; parasite clearance; parasite viability; parasitemia; pharmacodynamic parameters; pharmacokinetic parameters; pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic model.; Plasmodium falciparum; prediction; priority journal; single drug dose; steady state; time series analysis; time to maximum plasma concentration; trophozoite,Article

Currently, the two modern techniques that are widely used are hook plate (HP) fixation and coracoclavicular ligament fixation using a suspensory loop device that consists of either a tightrope (single or double), endo-button (single or double), or synthetic ligament and absorbable polydioxansulfate sling. Materials and methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Relevant studies that reported Constant-Murley score (CMS), Pain Visual Analog score (VAS) and postoperative complications of either technique were identified from Medline and Scopus from inception to 5 October 2015. Results: Sixteen studies were included for the analysis of HP fixation, and 25 studies were included for analysis of loop suspensory fixation (LSF). Pooling of mean CMS and VAS scores gave 90.35 (95% CI 87.16, 93.54), 1.51 (95% CI 0.73, 2) in the HP group, and 92.48 (95% CI 90.91, 94.05), 0.32 (95% CI 0, 0.64) in the suspensory loop devices group, respectively. The pooled unstandardized mean differences (UMD) scores of CMS and VAS in LSF were 2.13 (95% CI −1.43, 5.69) and −1.19 (95% CI −2.03, −0.35) when compared to hook plating. The pooled prevalence of LSF and hook plating were 0.08 (95% CI 0.06, 0.10) and 0.05 (95% CI 0.02, 0.08) scores. The chance of having complications in the LSF group was 1.69 (95% CI 1.07, 2.60), which was statistically significantly higher than in the HP group. Conclusion: LSF have higher shoulder function scores (CMS) and lower postoperative pain when compared to HP fixation; however, there are higher complication rates with LSF when compared to hook plating.

In an ethnically diverse dataset, selected according to a high-risk HbA1c-based definition of prediabetes, we have investigated relationships between glycaemia and cardiometabolic risk factors and the influence of ethnicity on these relationships. Methods We undertook a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a diabetes prevention study in the UK and a chronic care clinic in Thailand, selected for people without diabetes (fasting plasma glucose <7.0 mmol/l) with HbA1c 6.0–6.4% (42–47 mmol/mol). Thai (n = 158) and UK White (n = 600), South Asian (n = 112), Black (n = 70) and other/mixed (n = 103) groups were distinguished and measurements included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), blood pressure (BP), lipids and insulin resistance-related risk factors (IRFs). Results Independently of individual characteristics including ethnicity, only systolic BP was weakly associated with FPG (beta coefficient 1.76 (95%CI 0.10–3.42), p 0.03) and only LDL-c with IFG (FPG 5.6 to <7) (adjusted −0.14 (−0.27, −0.003) p 0.04). There were no significant independent associations with cardiometabolic risk factors when categories of impaired fasting glucose (FPG ≥ 6.1 to <7.0 mmol/L) were considered. Relative to White, South Asian ethnicity was independently associated with lower systolic and diastolic BP, Black with lower triglycerides, cholesterol/HDL-c ratio and having 2 or more IRFs, and Thai with lower cholesterol/HDL-c ratio and all three non-white ethnicities with lower total and LDL cholesterol. Conclusion In high-risk HbA1c-defined prediabetes additional measurement of FPG will add little to evaluation of cardiometabolic risk. Additionally, UK Whites tend to have the most adverse cardiometabolic profile of any ethnic group. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cardiometabolic risk factor; Ethnicity; Fasting plasma glucose; HbA1c; Impaired fasting glucose; Prediabetes,cholesterol; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; glycosylated hemoglobin; abdominal obesity; adult; age; aged; Article; Black person; cardiometabolic risk; Caucasian; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; diet restriction; ethnicity; female; gender; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; impaired glucose tolerance; major clinical study; male; South Asian; systolic blood pressure; Thai (people); triacylglycerol blood level; adolescent; blood; cardiovascular disease; diabetes mellitus; ethnic group; glucose blood level; impaired glucose tolerance; metabolic disorder; metabolism; middle aged; risk factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Ethnic Groups; Fasting; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Middle Aged; Prediabetic State; Risk Factors; Young Adult,Article

Studies have highlighted the importance of Bp and Bm lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as vaccine candidates. Here we describe the synthesis of seven oligosaccharides as the minimal structures featuring all of the reported acetylation/methylation patterns associated with Bp and Bm LPS O-antigens (OAgs). Our approach is based on the conversion of an l-rhamnose into a 6-deoxy-l-talose residue at a late stage of the synthetic sequence. Using biochemical and biophysical methods, we demonstrate the binding of several Bp and Bm LPS-specific monoclonal antibodies with terminal OAg residues. Mice immunized with terminal disaccharide-CRM197 constructs produced high-titer antibody responses that crossreacted with Bm-like OAgs. Collectively, these studies serve as foundation for the development of novel therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccine candidates to combat diseases caused by Bp and Bm. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"bacterial vaccine; bacterium lipopolysaccharide; diphtheria toxoid CRM197; disaccharide; epitope; glycoconjugate; monoclonal antibody; O antigen; oc 2808; oc 4744; rhamnose; soc 6; soc 7; trisaccharide; unclassified drug; bacterial antigen; bacterial protein; bacterial vaccine; epitope; lipopolysaccharide; monoclonal antibody; antibody; antigen; bacterium; biochemistry; biophysics; chemical reaction; disease severity; etiology; vaccine; acetylation; animal experiment; animal model; antibody production; antibody response; antibody titer; antigen binding; antigen recognition; Article; biotinylation; Burkholderia mallei; Burkholderia pseudomallei; controlled study; cross reaction; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epitope mapping; female; glanders; glycosylation; human; hydrogenolysis; immune response; immunogenicity; isomerization; melioidosis; methylation; mouse; nonhuman; regioselectivity; animal; Bagg albino mouse; Burkholderia mallei; Burkholderia pseudomallei; chemistry; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; melioidosis; metabolism; physiology; Animalia; Burkholderia mallei; Burkholderia pseudomallei; Mus; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Vaccines; Burkholderia mallei; Burkholderia pseudomallei; Epitopes; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Lipopolysaccharides; Melioidosis; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C",Article

Materials and methods Patients meeting APACHE II inclusion criteria admitted to 18 ICUs in Sri Lanka over three consecutive months had data necessary for the calculation of APACHE II, probabilities prospectively extracted from case notes. APACHE II physiology score (APS), probabilities, Standardised (ICU) Mortality Ratio (SMR), discrimination (AUROC), and calibration (C-statistic) were calculated, both by imputing missing measurements with normal values and by Multiple Imputation using Chained Equations (MICE). Results From a total of 995 patients admitted during the study period, 736 had APACHE II probabilities calculated. Data availability for APS calculation ranged from 70.6% to 88.4% for bedside observations and 18.7% to 63.4% for invasive measurements. SMR (95% CI) was 1.27 (1.17, 1.40) and 0.46 (0.44, 0.49), AUROC (95% CI) was 0.70 (0.65, 0.76) and 0.74 (0.68, 0.80), and C-statistic was 68.8 and 156.6 for normal value imputation and MICE, respectively. Conclusions An incomplete dataset confounds interpretation of prognostic model performance in LMICs, wherein imputation using normal values is not a suitable strategy. Improving data availability, researching imputation methods and developing setting-adapted and simpler prognostic models are warranted. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,APACHE; calculation; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle income country; mortality; normal value; physiology; probability,Article

These results encourage future studies focusing on mechanisms leading to fracture associated with burn injury. Introduction: The relationship between burn injury and hip fracture risk is unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate this relationship. Methods: From insurance data of Taiwan, we identified a cohort with 16,430 burn patients in 2000–2010 and a comparison cohort of 65,716 persons without the history of burn, frequency matched by sex, age, and diagnosis date. Both cohorts were followed up to the end of 2011 to evaluate the risk of hip fracture. Results: Patients with burn injury were 1.62-fold more likely than comparisons to encounter a hip fracture (6.95 vs. 4.28 per 1000 person-years), with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.54 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40–1.68). The fracture incidence increased with age and is slightly greater for women than for men in both cohorts. The fracture risk was greater for patients with burn in the eyes, face, and head with an incidence of 7.14 per 1000 person-years, or an aHR of 2.09 (95% CI = 1.53, 2.86). Diabetes and osteoporosis were also associated with an increased hip fracture risk. Conclusion: Burn injury is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. Diabetes and osteoporosis are associated with an enhanced risk. © 2017, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Burn injury; Hip fracture; Insurance data; Osteoporosis; Retrospective cohort study,adult; age distribution; Article; burn; cohort analysis; diabetes mellitus; eye burn; face burn; female; head injury; hip fracture; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; osteoporosis; priority journal; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; Taiwan,Article

Patients with stroke are at a higher risk developing pneumonia; however, the association between stroke and pleural empyema risk is largely unknown. We used the data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan to establish a stroke group consisting of 466,170 patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010, and a non-stroke group consisting of the same number of individuals matched by the propensity score. Incident pleural empyema was monitored toward the end of 2011. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of pleural empyema in the stroke group, compared to the non-stroke group, were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. We found that the incidence of pleural empyema is 2.69-fold higher in the stroke group than in the non-stroke group (15.2 vs. 5.59/10,000 person-years, p < 0.001), with an aHR of 2.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.72–3.08]. Further analysis reveals the aHRs of pleural empyema to be 2.62 (95% CI = 2.45–2.79) in patients with ischemic stroke and 4.53 (95% CI = 4.14–4.95) in patients with hemorrhagic stroke compared with those without stroke. In addition, we observe that stroke patients with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt implantation exhibit more than sevenfold risk for developing of pleural empyema. In conclusion, patients with stroke are at an elevated risk of developing pleural empyema. The risk is greater for those with hemorrhagic stroke than for those with ischemic stroke. The risk increases further for patients who undergo VP shunt implantation. © 2017, SIMI.",Cerebrovascular disease (stroke); Pleural empyema; Pneumonia,"adult; aged; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; complication; female; human; incidence; male; middle aged; pleura empyema; procedures; propensity score; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; Taiwan; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Empyema, Pleural; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Propensity Score; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke; Taiwan",Article

However, there has been little if any focus placed on the individual role of the “nonlength” HN features in EVAR outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate their individual and potentially predictive role in outcomes of EVAR under HN conditions. Methods Data of 156 consecutive EVAR patients with short (<15 mm) HN, treated with the Endurant device (Medtronic Cardiovascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) at three European academic vascular centers between 2007 and 2015, were collected and retrospectively analyzed. All patients had at least one of the four well-known nonlength HN criteria (width >32 mm or bulge, angulation >60 degrees, reverse taper anatomy, and circumferential thrombus or calcification >50%) and underwent standard EVAR without additional techniques, such as use of chimney grafts or endoanchors. Primary end points were absence of type IA endoleak at 1 month and midterm follow-up and aneurysm sac stabilization or shrinkage. Secondary end points were 30-day mortality, overall survival, and secondary interventions related to EVAR. The study cohort was classified in two subgroups related to neck length (length <10 mm and length between 10 and 14 mm) as well as in two subgroups according to on-label or off-label stent graft use. Results Mean clinical and radiologic follow-up was 41.1 ± 24.7 and 31.7 ± 19.0 months, respectively. Overall EVAR-related mortality was 1.9% (n = 3). The total type IA endoleak rate was 5.8% (n = 9). In four patients, the type IA endoleak was detected intraoperatively and solved by endovascular means. A type IA endoleak was detected in three patients at 1 month and in two patients at 2-year follow-up. During follow-up, five patients showed an increase of aneurysm diameter due to type II endoleak and were treated by secondary endovascular reinterventions. The total number of all EVAR-related secondary procedures in the midterm was 12 (7.7%). Univariate analysis showed that the center of treatment and the clinical or anatomic features were not associated with adverse outcomes. Multiple regression and Cox regression analysis of HN features revealed that reverse taper anatomy (conical neck) was the single and significantly associated predictor of proximal EVAR failure (P <.012). Width >32 mm, angulation >60 degrees, and calcification or thrombus were not associated with adverse outcomes. Analysis between HN length cohorts and between on-label and off-label subgroups revealed no difference in outcomes. Conclusions A conical neck in hostile anatomies represents the single strongest factor associated with proximal failure of standard EVAR. This finding should be considered and highlighted apart from the length of the infrarenal neck to prevent midterm failure of standard EVAR. © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery",,"abdominal aortic aneurysm; adult; adverse outcome; aged; Article; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; chimney test; chronic kidney failure; coil embolization; computed tomographic angiography; conical neck abdominal aortic aneurysm; controlled study; endoleak; endovascular aneurysm repair; female; follow up; human; intraoperative period; major clinical study; male; overall survival; priority journal; prospective study; retrospective study; abdominal aorta; abdominal aortic aneurysm; aortography; blood vessel prosthesis; blood vessel transplantation; chi square distribution; clinical trial; devices; diagnostic imaging; endoleak; endovascular surgery; Europe; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; procedures; proportional hazards model; prosthesis design; retreatment; risk factor; stent; time factor; treatment failure; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aorta, Abdominal; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal; Aortography; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Chi-Square Distribution; Computed Tomography Angiography; Endoleak; Endovascular Procedures; Europe; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prosthesis Design; Retreatment; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Failure",Article

In this study, we use a combination of molecular and geometric morphometric analyses to quantify the genetic structure and diversity of the T. collina population of Thailand. We found striking regional differences in both mitochondrial haplotype frequencies and morphology. A Bayesian analyses of molecular diversity of the mitochondrial COI region revealed two clades, roughly divided into the population northeast of the Thai-Malay Peninsula (clade A) and the western and Thai-Malay Peninsula population (clade B). In addition, morphometric analysis showed that bees in clade A have significantly larger wings than bees from clade B. These results suggest that the T. collina population of Thailand is divided into two distinct populations. The spatial distributions seem to reflect contemporary ecological features such as annual flooding (bees of clade B are absent from areas subject to inundation), rather than past biogeography. Thus, T. collina differs from the honey bees Apis dorsata and A. cerana that show genetic differentiation north and south of the Isthmus of Kra, perhaps reflective of past separation during the Pleistocene when sea levels were much higher. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.",biogeography; genetic variation; geometric morphometrics; Isthmus of Kra; stingless bees; Tetragonilla collina,bee; biogeography; flooding; genetic analysis; genetic differentiation; genetic structure; genetic variation; mitochondrion; molecular analysis; morphometry; Indochina; Isthmus of Kra; Malay Peninsula; Apidae; Apis dorsata; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Meliponinae,Article

There are various cultivars of longan throughout the Thai-Malay peninsula region, but until now no phylogenetic analysis has been undertaken to determine the genetic relatedness of these cultivars. To address this issue, 6 loci, namely ITS2, matK, rbcL, trnH-psbA, trnL-I and trnL-trnF were amplified and sequenced from 40 individuals consisting of 26 longan cultivars 2 types of lychee and 8 herbarium samples. The sequencing results were used to construct a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) criteria. The tree showed cryptic groups of D. longan from the Thailand-Malaysia region (Dimocarpus longan spp.). This is the first report of the genetic relationship of Dimocarpus based on multi-locus molecular markers and morphological characteristics.

Ltd., Singapore","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with neurodegenerative changes resulting clinically in progressive cognitive and functional deficits. The only therapies are the cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor antagonist memantine. Donepezil acts primarily on the cholinergic system as a symptomatic treatment, but it also has potential for disease modification and may reduce the rate of progression of AD. This review explores the potential for disease modifying effects of donepezil. Several neuroprotective mechanisms that are independent of cholinesterase inhibition, are suggested. Donepezil has demonstrated a range of effects, including protecting against amyloid β, ischaemia and glutamate toxicity; slowing of progression of hippocampal atrophy; and up-regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Clinically, early and continuous treatment with donepezil is considered to preserve cognitive function more effectively than delayed treatment. The possible neuroprotective effects of donepezil and the potential for disease pathway modification highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment initiation in AD. © 2017 The British Pharmacological Society",,amyloid beta protein; brain derived neurotrophic factor; bungarotoxin receptor; cholinesterase; donepezil; glycogen synthase kinase 3; n acetylaspartic acid; neurotrophin receptor p75; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; Alzheimer disease; brain atrophy; brain blood flow; cholinesterase inhibition; disease course; enzyme activation; excitotoxicity; glutamate excitotoxicity; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; neurofibrillary tangle; neuroprotection; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; upregulation,Review

Methods AMG in n-hexane fraction was isolated on a silica gel column and chemically analyzed by HPLC and NMR. The antibiofilm activity of this compound was investigated by using a 96-well plate model for the formation of biofilms. Biofilm biomass was quantified using crystal violet. The viability of cells was observed under confocal microscopy using LIVE/DEAD BacLight stains. Biofilm composition was determined using specific chemical and enzyme tests for polysaccharide, protein and DNA. Membrane-damaging activity was assayed by measuring the hemolysis of human red blood cells in presence of AMG. Results The results indicated that the isolated AMG, with a purity that exceeded 98%, had minimal inhibitory concentrations in the range of 4.6–9.2 μmol/L for the three strains tested. Interestingly, the MSSA strains were more sensitive to AMG than the MRSA strain. Minimal bactericidal concentrations were 2-fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration values for the three strains, indicating that AMG was a bactericidal compound. AMG also prevented biofilm formation effectively, albeit that again the MRSA strain was the most resistant. Interestingly, biofilms of the MRSA strain contained protein as a main component of the extracellular matrix, whereas this was polysaccharide in the MSSA strains. This might relate to the resistance of the MRSA 252 strain to AMG. Assays using human red blood cells indicated that AMG caused significant membrane damage with 50% of cell lysis occurred at concentration of about 36 μmol/L. Conclusions Our results provide evidence that the isolated AMG has inhibitory activity against biofilm formation by S. aureus, including MRSA. Thus, isolated AMG proposes a high potential to develop a novel phytopharmaceutical for the treatment of MRSA. © 2017 Hainan Medical University",Biofilms; Garcinia mangostana; Methicillin resistance; Staphylococcus aureus; α-Mangostin,alpha mangostin; crystal violet; deoxyribonuclease I; DNA; Garcinia mangostana extract; hexane; periodate; plant extract; polysaccharide; protein; proteinase K; silica gel; unclassified drug; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial strain; bactericidal activity; biofilm; biomass; cell assay; cell viability; chemical analysis; concentration response; confocal microscopy; controlled study; drug purity; drug structure; enzyme analysis; extracellular matrix; Garcinia mangostana; hemolysis; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; membrane damage; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; minimum bactericidal concentration; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; plant growth; priority journal; Staphylococcus aureus; strain difference; Viet Nam,Article

Several noninvasive diagnostic scoring systems have been developed to determine the severity of liver fibrosis and to predict long-term outcome of patients with NAFLD in lieu of liver biopsy. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the role of NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) for prediction of mortality from NAFLD. Methods MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched through October 2016 for studies that investigated the association between high NFS and mortality. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity of effect-size was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Results A total of five cohort studies with 5033 NAFLD patients were identified. High NFS (score of greater than 0.675) was significantly associated with increased mortality with the pooled RR of 4.54 (95%CI: 1.85–11.17). The statistical heterogeneity was high with I2 of 88% (Pheterogeneity &lt; 0.01). Conclusions High NFS is associated with increased risk of mortality among patients with NAFLD.

This is because these algae can serve as the primary source of carbon for higher trophic levels, including fishes, but can also form harmful blooms, threatening local fisheries and environmental and human health. We monitored the dynamics of three cyanobacteria—Synechococcus spp., Microcystis aeruginosa, and Dolichospermum spp.—for two years in nine large lakes and reservoirs in the Mekong River Basin. The densities of these algae were largely system-specific such that their abundance was uniquely determined within individual water bodies. However, after accounting for the system-specific effect, we found that cell densities of Synechococcus spp., M. aeruginosa, and Dolichospermum spp. varied in response to changes in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), total nitrogen, and water level, respectively. Because both PAR and water level tend to fluctuate concordantly over a wide geographic area, Synechococcus spp., and to a lesser extent Dolichospermum spp., varied synchronously among the water bodies. Sustaining the production of pico-sized primary producers while preventing harmful algal blooms will be a key management goal for the proposed reservoirs in the Mekong Basin. © 2017 Fukushima et al.

Vaccines would offer an effective control measure against this disease. We previously reported on the utility of marmosets as an animal model for studying primary and secondary dengue infections. Infected marmosets consistently develop viraemia and antibody kinetics that reflect those of patients with dengue. Thus, it is important to determine the utility of marmosets as an animal model for demonstrating vaccine efficacy. In this study, marmosets were inoculated with candidate vaccine and parent strains and challenged with a clinical DENV strain. The viraemia and antibody kinetics in these marmosets were determined. Marmosets consistently develop lower viraemia with an attenuated vaccine strain. During secondary challenge, the IgM response was delayed, whereas the IgG levels rose rapidly, indicating a secondary antibody response. The neutralizing activities against the homotypic serotype were high; all marmosets were protected against viraemia following secondary inoculation. The viraemia markers and antibody responses were consistent with those of human DENV infection and vaccinees. These results demonstrate the utility of marmosets as an animal model for the study of vaccine efficacy. © 2017 The Authors.",Antibody response; Dengue; Marmoset; Vaccine; Viremia,dengue vaccine; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; Article; Callithrix jacchus; controlled study; dengue; Dengue virus; nonhuman; primate model; priority journal; serotype; viremia; virus genome; virus immunity; virus strain,Article

The effects of silane treatment and compatibilizer on thermo-oxidative stability and mechanical properties were investigated. The silane-treated fiber and compatibilizer were found to enhance the thermo-oxidative stability of polymer. The mechanical properties of elasomer matrix were clearly enhanced with fiber loading. The role of surface treatment and compatibilizer was effectively functioned only along the longitudinal direction of fiber. Young’s and dynamic storage moduli (E′) along the fiber direction for the treated fiber composites with and without compatibilizer were comparable and much higher than those of the untreated fiber system. Tensile stress at 10–350% for the treated fiber composite was much higher than those of the matrix and untreated fiber composite. The tensile stress was further improved by the addition of compatibilizer.

Methods P. gingivalis biofilms were prepared from a chronic periodontitis subject. Erythrosine and cyanidin-3-glucoside were prepared and randomly allocated as follows: 110, 220, 330, and 440 μM erythrosine; 101, 202, 303, and 404 μM anthocyanin; and 440 μM erythrosine + 404 μM cyanidin-3-glucoside. There were 18 PDT experimental groups (non-irradiated/irradiated with a 532-nm green light diode laser at 1.29 J/cm2 for 60 s). The 3 controls were grouped as follows: biofilms exposed to the photosensitizers alone, biofilms exposed to the laser alone, and biofilms exposed to 0.12% chlorhexidine. All sample groups were cultured at 1, 3 and 6 h after PDT and incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 37 °C for 4 days. The surviving fraction was calculated from the log10 CFU/ml. The 330 and 440 μM erythrosine and the 440 μM erythrosine + 404 μM cyanidin-3-glucoside were mixed with spin traps (TEMPO, DMPO), and the electron spin resonance spectra were evaluated. Results The log10 CFU/ml measurements showed that the PDT groups with 330 μM or 440 μM erythrosine and 440 μM erythrosine + 404 μM cyanidin-3-glucoside had statistically significant differences from the other groups (one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's multiple comparison test, p- value ≤ 0.05).

Our aim was to compare the efficiency of 2D induction with 3D induction method in their ability to generate NPCs, and subsequently neurons and astrocytes. Neural differentiation was analysed at the protein level qualitatively by immunocytochemistry and quantitatively by flow cytometry for NPC (SOX1, PAX6, NESTIN), neuronal (MAP2, TUBB3), cortical layer (TBR1, CUX1) and glial markers (SOX9, GFAP, AQP4). Electron microscopy demonstrated that both methods resulted in morphologically similar neural rosettes. However, quantification of NPCs derived from 3D neural induction exhibited an increase in the number of PAX6/NESTIN double positive cells and the derived neurons exhibited longer neurites. In contrast, 2D neural induction resulted in more SOX1 positive cells. While 2D monolayer induction resulted in slightly less mature neurons, at an early stage of differentiation, the patch clamp analysis failed to reveal any significant differences between the electrophysiological properties between the two induction methods. In conclusion, 3D neural induction increases the yield of PAX6+/NESTIN+ cells and gives rise to neurons with longer neurites, which might be an advantage for the production of forebrain cortical neurons, highlighting the potential of 3D neural induction, independent of iPSCs′ genetic background. © 2017 The Authors",2D-3D neural induction; Electron microscopy; hiPSC; Neural induction; Neural progenitor cells; Patch clamp,"aquaporin 4; glial fibrillary acidic protein; microtubule associated protein 2; nestin; protein; protein tubb3; transcription factor PAX6; transcription factor Sox1; transcription factor Sox9; unclassified drug; nestin; PAX6 protein, human; SOX1 protein, human; transcription factor PAX6; transcription factor Sox; 2d neural induction; 3d neural induction; Article; astrocyte; brain cell; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell reprogramming technique; cellular parameters; controlled study; electron microscopy; electrophysiology; flow cytometry; forebrain; human; human cell; human induced pluripotent stem cell; immunocytochemistry; induced pluripotent stem cell; intermethod comparison; nerve cell; neural crest cell; neural stem cell; neurite; priority journal; rosette formation; cell culture technique; cell line; comparative study; cytology; genetics; induced pluripotent stem cell; metabolism; neural stem cell; procedures; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Nestin; Neural Stem Cells; PAX6 Transcription Factor; SOXB1 Transcription Factors",Article

We evaluated risk of hospitalization for adverse respiratory events (acute exacerbation, pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure) and mortality in asthmatic adults with and without periodontal treatment. Methods We used National Health Insurance (NHI) claims data of Taiwan to identify 4771 asthmatic adults with periodontal disease who underwent periodontal treatment during 2000–2006. The control group consisted of asthmatic adults without periodontal disease at a 1:1 ratio matched by the propensity score. Both groups were followed up for 5 years to estimate the risk of hospitalization for adverse respiratory events and mortality. Results Compared with controls, the periodontal treatment group had lower overall incidence of hospitalization for adverse respiratory events [5.41 vs. 6.07 per 100 person-years, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.78–0.92] and intensive care unit admissions (1.14 vs. 1.25 per 100 person-years, 95% CI = 0.79–0.99). In addition, the all-cause mortality rate was significantly lower in the periodontal treatment group than in the control group during the follow-up period (1.86 vs. 2.79 per 100 person-years, 95% CI = 0.59–0.71). Conclusion Asthmatic adults who underwent periodontal treatment were at lower risk of hospitalization for adverse respiratory events and mortality than those without periodontal disease. Asthmatic adults should adopt more precautionary oral hygiene and ensure that they undergo regular periodontal health checkups. © 2017 European Federation of Internal Medicine.",Acute exacerbation; Asthma; Periodontal disease; Pneumonia; Respiratory failure,acute respiratory failure; aged; all cause mortality; Article; asthma; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease exacerbation; female; follow up; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; incidence; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; mortality; mortality rate; periodontal disease; periodontal procedure; pneumonia,Article

However, the accuracy of diagnostic codes for sarcoidosis is unknown. Methods: The medical record-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project was searched to identify all potential adult cases of sarcoidosis between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2013 in Olmsted County, Minnesota, using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 135 (sarcoidosis). Complete medical records of those potential cases were individually reviewed. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed by the presence of non-caseating granuloma on histopathology, radiographic findings of intrathoracic sarcoidosis, and compatible clinical presentations. Positive predictive value (PPV) was estimated as the number of patients verified to have sarcoidosis divided by the number of patients with a diagnostic code for sarcoidosis. Results: The study cohort included 366 patients with at least one code for sarcoidosis. Of these, 224 cases of confirmed sarcoidosis were identified, resulting in PPV of 61.2% (95% CI 56.0–66.2%). A total of 268 patients in the database had a code for sarcoidosis on least two occasions separated by at least 30 days. Of these, there were 205 cases of confirmed sarcoidosis. The PPV for having the code at least twice was 76.5% (95% CI 71.0–81.4%). Conclusions: The PPV of ICD-9 code for sarcoidosis is relatively low and, thus, further verification is required for studies using electronic databases. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Accuracy; Diagnostic coding; Electronic database; Sarcoidosis,adult; Article; clinical feature; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; electronic medical record; female; granuloma; histopathology; human; ICD-9; lung sarcoidosis; major clinical study; male; population research; predictive value; priority journal; radiodiagnosis,Article

SP-420 was administered as a single dose of 1.5 (n = 3), 3 (n = 3), 6 (n = 3), 12 (n = 3), and 24 (n = 6) mg/kg or as a twice-daily dose of 9 mg/kg (n = 6) over 14-28 days. There was a near dose-linear increase in the mean plasma SP-420 concentrations and in the mean values for Cmax and AUC0-τ over the dose range evaluated. The median tmax ranged from 0.5 to 2.25 h and was not dose dependent. The study was prematurely terminated by the sponsor due to renal adverse events (AE) including proteinuria, increase in serum creatinine, and one case of Fanconi syndrome. Other adverse effects included hypersensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal disturbances. Based on current dose administration, the renal AE observed outweighed the possible benefits from chelation therapy. However, additional studies assessing efficacy and safety of lower doses or less frequent dosing of SP-420 over longer durations with close monitoring would be necessary to better explain the findings of our study and characterize the safety of the study drug. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; creatinine; electrolyte; infusion fluid; iron chelating agent; sp 420; unclassified drug; cyclohexanone derivative; deferriferrithiocin; dihydropyridine derivative; iron chelating agent; siderophore; SP-420; thiazole derivative; abdominal distension; abdominal pain; acute kidney failure; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; allergic reaction; area under the curve; arthralgia; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; beta thalassemia; clinical article; creatinine blood level; drug blood level; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug hypersensitivity; drug safety; drug withdrawal; Fanconi renotubular syndrome; female; gastrointestinal symptom; glucosuria; hemolysis; hospitalization; human; hyperphosphatemia; hypertransaminasemia; hypokalemia; hypomagnesemia; hypophosphatemia; maculopapular rash; male; maximum plasma concentration; multicenter study; nausea; open study; phase 1 clinical trial; priority journal; proteinuria; single drug dose; thrombocytopenia; time to maximum plasma concentration; adolescent; beta thalassemia; blood transfusion; chemically induced; clinical trial; complication; dose response; kidney disease; middle aged; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; beta-Thalassemia; Blood Transfusion; Cyclohexanones; Dihydropyridines; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Iron Chelating Agents; Kidney Diseases; Middle Aged; Siderophores; Thiazoles; Young Adult",Article

Typical features at death are high parasite loads and obstructed micro- vasculature. Infected erythrocytes (IE) containing mature parasites bind to the host receptor heparan sulfate, which is also an important receptor for merozoite invasion. To block merozoite invasion has not previously been proposed as an adjunctive therapeutic approach but it may preclude the early expansion of an infection that else leads to exacerbated sequestration and death. Sevuparin in phase I study The drug sevuparin was developed from heparin because heparan sulfate and heparin are nearly identical, so the rationale was that sevuparin would act as a decoy receptor during malaria infection. A phase I study was performed in healthy male volunteers and sevuparin was found safe and well tolerated. Sevuparin in phase I/II clinical study A phase I/II clinical study was performed in which sevuparin was administered via short intravenous infusions to malaria patients with uncomplicated malaria who were also receiving atovaquone/proguanil treatment. This was a Phase I/II, randomized, open label, active control, parallel assignment study. Sevuparin was safe and well tolerated in the malaria patients. The mean relative numbers of ring-stage IEs decreased after a single sevuparin infusion and mature parasite IEs appeared transiently in the circulation. The effects observed on numbers of merozoites and throphozoites in the circulation, were detected already one hour after the first sevuparin injection. Here we report the development of a candidate drug named sevuparin that both blocks merozoite invasion and transiently de-sequesters IE in humans with P. falciparum malaria. © 2017 Leitgeb et al.

Methods: We used data from a prospective observational study in patients admitted to a mixed medical–surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in the Netherlands. Risk stratification was by cutoffs for SpO2/FiO2 and PEEP. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Patients with moderate or severe ARDS with a length of stay of &gt; 24 h were included in this study. Patients were assigned to four predefined risk groups: group I (SpO2/FiO2 ≥ 190 and PEEP &lt; 10 cm H2O), group II (SpO2/FiO2 ≥ 190 and PEEP ≥ 10 cm), group III (SpO2/FiO2 &lt; 190 and PEEP &lt; 10 cm H2O) and group IV (SpO2/FiO2 &lt; 190 and PEEP ≥ 10 cm H2O). Results: The analysis included 456 patients. SpO2/FiO2 and PaO2/FiO2 had a strong relationship (P &lt; 0.001, R2 = 0.676) that could be described in a linear regression equation (SpO2/FiO2 = 42.6 + 1.0 * PaO2/FiO2). Risk stratification at initial ARDS diagnosis resulted in groups that had no differences in in-hospital mortality. Risk stratification at 24 h resulted in groups with increasing mortality rates. The association between group assignment at 24 h and outcome was confounded by several factors, including APACHE IV scores, arterial pH and plasma lactate levels, and vasopressor therapy. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with moderate or severe ARDS, SpO2/FiO2 and PaO2/FiO2 have a strong linear relationship. In contrast to risk stratification at initial ARDS diagnosis, risk stratification using SpO2/FiO2 and PEEP after 24 h resulted in groups with worsening outcomes. Risk stratification using SpO2/FiO2 and PEEP could be practical, especially in resource-limited settings. © 2017, The Author(s).",Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); Blood gas analysis; Classification; Mortality; Outcome; Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); Pulse oximetry; Risk stratification,hypertensive factor; lactic acid; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; APACHE; arterial oxygen saturation; arterial pH; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; female; fraction of inspired oxygen; high risk population; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; inspiratory capacity; intensive care unit; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; mortality risk; observational study; outcome assessment; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; prospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; surgical intensive care unit,Article

We investigated the role of environmental factors on ACL distribution in Herat. Epidemiological data from 2457 patients were retrieved from the local WHO sub-office. Shapefile layers of districts, cities, villages, land cover, soil type and digital elevation model (DEM) of the Herat province were used to assess, by logistic regression modelling, the effects of land cover, soil types, elevation, and proximity to the Harirud river on the distribution of ACL. The key determinants of distribution were: (i) close proximity to the Harirud river, (ii) elevation between 700 and 1200 m, (iii) intensive and intermittent irrigated cultivated land, and (iv) Haplocalcids with Torriorthents and Torrifluvents soil types. No ACL cases were found below 700 m, and a few cases were present at >1200 m in irrigated areas around the Harirud river. These findings suggest that moist soil and the humidity from irrigated areas found between 700 and 1200 m provide suitable breeding sites of Phlebotomus sergenti, the main sandfly vector of L. tropica in Afghanistan. The effect of elevation also explains the predominance of ACL over ZCL in this region. The present study showed that distribution of ACL is strongly associated with environmental factors in West Afghanistan where the political and socio-economic conditions may also affect the epidemiology of CL. © 2017",Afghanistan; Anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL); Environmental factors; Epidemiology; GIS,"digital elevation model; disease spread; disease vector; environmental factor; epidemiology; GIS; leishmaniasis; spatial distribution; adolescent; adult; Afghanistan; aged; anthroponosis; Article; child; controlled study; cultivated land; environmental factor; female; geographic elevation; human; humidity; infant; infection; insect vector; irrigation (agriculture); land use; Leishmania tropica; male; Phlebotominae; Phlebotomus sergenti; politics; river; skin leishmaniasis; socioeconomics; soil; soil moisture; animal; disease carrier; middle aged; parasitology; Phlebotomus; preschool child; skin leishmaniasis; transmission; very elderly; young adult; Afghanistan; Herat; Leishmania tropica; Phlebotomus sergenti; Adolescent; Adult; Afghanistan; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Reservoirs; Female; Humans; Humidity; Infant; Insect Vectors; Leishmania tropica; Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous; Male; Middle Aged; Phlebotomus; Soil; Young Adult",Article

The objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes of substituting antiretroviral regimen in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients in non-clinical trial settings in Asian countries. Methods: The study population consisted of HIV-infected patients enrolled in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD). Individuals were included in this analysis if they started combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) after 2002, were being treated at a centre that documented a median rate of viral load monitoring ≥0.8 tests/patient/year among TAHOD enrolees, and experienced a minor or major treatment substitution while on virally suppressive cART. The primary endpoint to evaluate outcomes was clinical or virological failure (VF), followed by an ART class change. Clinical failure was defined as death or an AIDS diagnosis. VF was defined as confirmed viral load measurements ≥400 copies/mL followed by an ART class change within six months. Minor regimen substitutions were defined as within-class changes and major regimen substitutions were defined as changes to a drug class. The patterns of substitutions and rate of clinical or VF after substitutions were analyzed. Results: Of 3994 adults who started ART after 2002, 3119 (78.1%) had at least one period of virological suppression. Among these, 1170 (37.5%) underwent a minor regimen substitution, and 296 (9.5%) underwent a major regimen substitution during suppression. The rates of clinical or VF were 1.48/100 person years (95% CI 1.14 to 1.91) in the minor substitution group, 2.85/100 person years (95% CI 1.88 to 4.33) in the major substitution group and 2.53/100 person years (95% CI 2.20 to 2.92) among patients that did not undergo a treatment substitution. Conclusions: The rate of clinical or VF was low in both major and minor substitution groups, showing that regimen substitution is generally effective in non-clinical trial settings in Asian countries. © 2017 The Authors.

This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radotinib as first-line therapy for CML-CP. Experimental Design: This multinational, open-label study assigned patients (1:1:1) to one of two twice-daily radotinib doses, or imatinib daily. The primary endpoint was major molecular response (MMR) by 12 months. Results: Two hundred forty-one patients were randomized to receive radotinib 300 mg (n ¼ 79) or 400 mg twice-daily (n ¼ 81), or imatinib 400 mg daily (n ¼ 81). MMR rates by 12 months were higher in patients receiving radotinib 300 mg (52%) or radotinib 400 mg twice-daily (46%) versus imatinib (30%; P ¼ 0.0044 and P ¼ 0.0342, respectively). Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates by 12 months were higher for radotinib 300 mg (91%) versus imatinib (77%; P ¼ 0.0120). Early molecular response at 3 months occurred in 86% and 87% of patients receiving radotinib 300 mg and radotinib 400 mg, respectively, and 71% of those receiving imatinib. By 12 months, no patients had progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis. Most adverse events were manageable with dose reduction. Conclusions: Radotinib demonstrated superiority over imatinib in CCyR and MMR in patients newly diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome–positive CML-CP.

Methods: A cross-sectional telephone survey aimed at intern doctors working in all medical/surgical wards in government hospitals. Interns were interviewed based on the above objective. Results: A total of 42 CPR attempts from 82 hospitals (338 wards) were reported, 3 of which were excluded as the participating doctor was unavailable for interview. 16 (4.7%) wards had at least 1 patient with an informal DNAR order. 42 deaths were reported. 8 deaths occurred without a known resuscitation attempt, of which 6 occurred on wards with an informal DNAR order in place. 39 resuscitations were attempted. Survival at 24 h was 2 (5.1%). In 5 (13%) attempts, CPR was the only intervention reported. On 25 (64%) occasions, doctors were 'not at all' or 'only a little bit surprised' by the arrest. Conclusions: CPR attempts before death in hospitals across Sri Lanka is prevalent.

We reported a specific genetic risk factor through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that focused on young age onset TB. In this study, we further focused on the heterogeneity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) lineages and assessed its possible interaction with age at onset on host genetic factors. We identified the pathogen lineage in 686 Thai TB cases and GWAS stratified by both infected pathogen lineage information and age at onset revealed a genome-wide significant association of one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 1p13, which was specifically associated with non-Beijing lineage-infected old age onset cases (P=2.54E-08, OR=1.74 (95% CI=1.43-2.12)), when we compared them to the population-matched healthy controls. This SNP locates near the CD53 gene, which encodes a leukocyte surface glycoprotein. Interestingly, the expression of CD53 was also correlated with the patients' active TB status. This is the first report of a pathogen lineage-based genome-wide association study. The results suggested that host genetic risk in TB is depended upon the pathogen genetic background and demonstrate the importance of analyzing the interaction between host and pathogen genomes in TB.",,CD53 antigen; glycoprotein; spacer DNA; tetraspanin; transcriptome; Article; chromosome 1p; clinical assessment; controlled study; flow cytometry; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic background; genetic risk; genome; genome-wide association study; genotype; heredity; human; leukocyte; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; onset age; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; tuberculosis,Article

Phylogenetic trees and Bayesian skyline plots suggest a role of the glacial periods in the demographic history of swamp buffalo. The ancestral swamp-buffalo mitogenome is dated ∼232 ± 35 Kya. Two major macro-lineages diverged during the 2nd Pleistocene Glacial Period (∼200-130 Kya), but most (∼99%) of the current matrilines derive from only two ancestors (SA1′2 and SB) that lived around the Last Glacial Maximum (∼26-19 Kya). During the late Holocene optimum (11-6 Kya) lineages differentiated further, and at least eight matrilines (SA1, SA2, SB1a, SB1b, SB2a, SB2b, SB3 and SB4) were domesticated around 7-3 Kya. Haplotype distributions support an initial domestication process in Southeast Asia, while subsequent captures of wild females probably introduced some additional rare lineages (SA3, SC, SD and SE). Dispersal of domestic buffaloes created local population bottlenecks and founder events that further differentiated haplogroup distributions. A lack of maternal gene flow between neighboring populations apparently maintained the strong phylogeography of the swamp buffalo matrilines, which is the more remarkable because of an almost complete absence of phenotypic differentiation. © 2017 The Author(s).",,differentiation; domestication; gene flow; glacial period; haplogroup; haplotype; last glacial maximum; Late Holocene; mitochondrial genome; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogeography; population model; Southeast Asia; swamp; water buffalo,Article

The development of drug resistance in malaria parasites is an inevitable consequence of their widespread and often unregulated use. There is an urgent need for new and effective drugs. Pyronaridine is a known antimalarial drug that has received renewed interest as a partner drug in artemisinin-based combination therapy. To study its pharmacokinetic properties, particularly in field settings, it is necessary to develop and validate a robust, highly sensitive and accurate bioanalytical method for drug measurements in biological samples. We have developed a sensitive quantification method that covers a wide range of clinically relevant concentrations (1.5 ng/mL to 882 ng/mL) using a relatively low volume sample of 100 μL of whole blood. Total run time is 5 min and precision is within ±15% at all concentration levels. Pyronaridine was extracted on a weak cation exchange solid-phase column (SPE) and separated on a HALO RP amide fused-core column using a gradient mobile phase of acetonitrile–ammonium formate and acetonitrile-methanol. Detection was performed using electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (positive ion mode with selected reaction monitoring). The developed method is suitable for implementation in high-throughput routine drug analysis, and was used to quantify pyronaridine accurately for up to 42 days after a single oral dose in a drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers. © 2017 The Authors",Bioanalysis; Malaria; Pyramax; Pyronaridine; Whole blood,artesunate plus pyronaridine; edetic acid; primaquine; pyronaridine; Article; blood donor; blood sampling; cation exchange; controlled study; crossover procedure; drug blood level; drug determination; drug stability; electrospray mass spectrometry; elimination half-life; freeze thawing; high throughput screening; human; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; measurement accuracy; normal human; open study; plasma concentration-time curve; priority journal; solid phase extraction; tandem mass spectrometry; validation process,Article

Thirty randomly selected digital lateral cephalograms of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment were used in this study. Thirteen landmarks (S, N, Or, A-point, U1T, U1A, B-point, Gn, Pog, Me, Go, L1T, and L1A) were identified on the digital image by an automatic cephalometric software and on cephalometric tracing by manual method. Superimposition of printed image and manual tracing was done by registration at the soft tissue profiles. The accuracy of landmarks located by the automatic method was compared with that of the manually identified landmarks by measuring the mean differences of distances of each landmark on the Cartesian plane where X and Y coordination axes passed through the center of ear rod. One-Sample T test was used to evaluate the mean differences. Statistically significant mean differences (p<0.05) were found in 5 landmarks (Or, A-point, Me, L1T, and L1A) in horizontal direction and 7 landmarks (Or, A-point, U1T, U1A, B-point, Me, and L1A) in vertical direction. Four landmarks (Or, A-point, Me, and L1A) showed significant (p<0.05) mean differences in both horizontal and vertical directions. Small mean differences (<0.5mm) were found for S, N, B-point, Gn, and Pog in horizontal direction and N, Gn, Me, and L1T in vertical direction. Large mean differences were found for A-point (3.0 < 3.5mm) in horizontal direction and L1A (>4mm) in vertical direction. Only 5 of 13 landmarks (38.46%; S, N, Gn, Pog, and Go) showed no significant mean difference between the automatic and manual landmarking methods. It is concluded that if this automatic cephalometric analysis software is used for orthodontic diagnosis, the orthodontist must correct or modify the position of landmarks in order to increase the accuracy of cephalometric analysis. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Diagnosis; Manufacture; Patient treatment; Automatic cephalometric analysis; Automatic method; Cartesian plane; Cephalometric analysis; Landmark identification; Manual methods; Orthodontic treatments; Vertical direction; Dentistry,Conference Paper

Wire alloys with Nickel, Titanium, and Cobalt (purity-99.95%) with atomic weight ratio 47Ni:50Ti:3Co and 50.6Ni:49.4Ti were prepared, sliced, and cold-rolled at 30% reduction, followed by heat treatment in a furnace at 400oC for 1 hour. The specimens of wire size of 0.016 x 0.022 inch2 were cut and subjected to three-point bending test to investigate the load-deflection curve at deflection point 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 mm. Descriptive statistic was used to evaluate each variables and independent t-test was used to compare between the groups. The results presented a load-deflection curve that resembled a typical superelastic wire. However, significant differences were seen in the loading-unloading forces between the two with an average loading force of 412.53g and 304.98g and unloading force of 292.40g and 208.08g for NiTiCo and NiTi wire, respectively. The force at each deflection point of NiTiCo in loading-unloading force was higher than NiTi wire.

It is one of the common cause of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR). Clinical symptoms of LTG-induced CADR range from maculopapular exanthema (MPE) to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR). This study aimed to determine the association of the LTG-induced CADR with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in Thai patients. Methods: Fifteen patients with LTG-induced CADR [10 MPE; 4 Stevens-Johnson syndrome; and 1 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms] and 50 LTG-tolerant controls were included in the study. HLA-A and HLA-B genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotides probes. Results: The proportion of HLA-A*02:07 and HLA-B*15:02 allele carriers were significantly higher in the LTG-induced CADR group than in the tolerant controls [odds ratio (OR): 7.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60-38.25; P = 0.013, and OR: 4.89; 95% CI: 1.28-18.67; P = 0.014]. In addition, subjects with HLA-A*33:03, HLA-B*15:02, and HLA-B*44:03 were significantly higher in the LTG-induced MPE group than in the tolerant controls (OR: 8.27; 95% CI: 1.83-37.41; P = 0.005, OR: 7.33; 95% CI: 1.63-33.02; P = 0.005; and OR: 10.29; 95% CI: 1.45-72.81; P = 0.029). In contrast to the LTG-induced MPE group, there were no significant differences between HLA alleles and LTG-induced SCAR group. Conclusion: HLA-A*02:07 and HLA-B*15:02 were associated with LTG-induced CADR in Thai patients. We also identified an association between HLA-A*33:03, HLA-B*15:02, and HLA-B*44:03 and LTG-induced MPE in this population. These results suggest that these alleles could be useful screening markers for preventing CADR before LTG treatment in Thai patients, but further replication studies with larger sample sizes are needed. © 2017 Koomdee, Pratoomwun, Jantararoungtong, Theeramoke, Tassaneeyakul, Klaewsongkram, Rerkpattanapipat, Santon, Puangpetch, Intusoma, Tempark, Deesudchit, Satapornpong, Visudtibhan and Sukasem.",Cutaneous adverse drug reactions; HLA-A; HLA-B; Lamotrigine; Thai population,HLA A antigen; HLA B antigen; lamotrigine; adult; Article; bipolar disorder; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; DRESS syndrome; drug efficacy; drug safety; epilepsy; female; gene frequency; gene sequence; genetic association; genotype; HLAA gene; HLAB gene; human; informed consent; maculopapular rash; major depression; male; polymerase chain reaction; population research; sample size; Stevens Johnson syndrome; Thai (people),Article

Knowing treatments that can delay disease progression will lead to reduced mortality. We therefore aimed to estimate the effectiveness of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade on CKD progression. Methods: We conducted a retrospective CKD cohort at Ubon Ratchathani province, Thailand from 1997 to 2011. ESRD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <15 ml/min/1.73 m2, dialysis, or kidney transplantation. All-cause mortality was verified until December 31, 2011. A counterfactual-framework was applied to estimate the effectiveness of RAAS blockade on outcomes, i.e., ESRD, death before and after ESRD. RAAS blockade was categorized according to duration of use <0.25 year, 0.25-1 year (RAAS1), and >1 year (RAAS2). An augmented inverse-probability weighting (AIPW) method was used to estimate potential-outcome mean (POM) and average treatment-effect (ATE). Multi-logit and Poisson regressions were used for treatment and outcome models, respectively. Analyses were stratified by ESRD, death before/after ESRD for diabetic and non-diabetic groups. STATA 14.0 was used for statistical analyses. Results: Among 15,032 diabetic patients, 2346 (15.6%), 2351 (18.5%), and 1607 (68.5%) developed ESRD, died before ESRD, and died after ESRD, respectively. Only RAAS2 effect was significant on ESRD, death before and after ESRD. The ESRD rates were 12.9%, versus 20.0% for RAAS2 and non-RAAS, respectively, resulted in significant risk differences (RD) of -7.2% (95% CI: -8.8%, -5.5%), and a numbers needed-to-treat (NNT) of 14. Death rates before ESRD for these corresponding groups were 14.4% (12.9%, 15.9%) and 19.6% (18.7%, 20.4%) with a NNT of 19. Death rates after ESRD in RAAS2 was lower than non-RASS group (i.e., 62.8% (55.5%, 68.9%) versus 68.1% (65.9%, 70.4%)) but this was not significant. RAAS2 effects on ESRD and death before ESRD were persistently significant in non-diabetic patients (n = 17,074) but not for death after ESRD with the NNT of about 15 and 16 respectively. Conclusions: Receiving RAAS blockade for 1 year or longer could prevent both CKD progression to ESRD and premature mortality. © 2017 The Author(s).",,angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; adult; albuminuria; Article; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; dialysis; drug use; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; kidney transplantation; major clinical study; male; mortality; outcome assessment; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; retrospective study; risk factor; Thailand; treatment duration,Article

There is an urgent need to consider alternative, accelerated strategies to eliminate malaria in countries like Lao PDR, where there are a few remaining endemic areas. A deterministic compartmental modelling tool was used to develop an integrated strategy for P. falciparum elimination in the Savannakhet province of Lao PDR. The model was designed to include key aspects of malaria transmission and integrated control measures, along with a user-friendly interface. Results: Universal coverage was the foundation of the integrated strategy, which took the form of the deployment of community health workers who provided universal access to early diagnosis, treatment and long-lasting insecticidal nets. Acceleration was included as the deployment of three monthly rounds of mass drug administration targeted towards high prevalence villages, with the addition of three monthly doses of the RTS,S vaccine delivered en masse to the same high prevalence sub-population. A booster dose of vaccine was added 1 year later. The surveillance-as-intervention component of the package involved the screening and treatment of individuals entering the simulated population. Conclusions: In this modelling approach, the sequential introduction of a series of five available interventions in an integrated strategy was predicted to be sufficient to stop malaria transmission within a 3-year period. These interventions comprised universal access to early diagnosis and adequate treatment, improved access to long-lasting insecticidal nets, three monthly rounds of mass drug administration together with RTS,S vaccination followed by a booster dose of vaccine, and screening and treatment of imported cases. © 2017 The Author(s).",Laos; Malaria elimination; Malaria surveillance; Mass Vaccination and Drug Administration (MVDA); Mathematical model; Plasmodium falciparum; Savannakhet,8 aminoquinoline derivative; dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine; malaria vaccine; primaquine; Article; compartment model; controlled study; disease elimination; disease surveillance; early diagnosis; health auxiliary; health care access; human; Laos; low drug dose; malaria; malaria control; malaria falciparum; mass screening; mathematical model; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax malaria; population research; prevalence; sensitivity and specificity; simulation; single drug dose; vaccination,Article

The aim of this investigation was to assess associations between dietary behaviours and psychological well-being and distress among school-going adolescents in Korea. Methods: In a cross-sectional nationally representative survey, 65,212 students (Mean age = 15.1 years, SE = 0.02 and 52.2% male and 47.8% female) responded to a questionnaire that included measures of dietary behaviour, psychological well-being and mental distress. Results: In logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, school level, school types, Body Mass Index, physical activity, and substance use, positive dietary behaviours (regular breakfast, fruit, vegetable, and milk consumption) were positively and unhealthy dietary behaviours (intake of caffeine, soft drinks, sweet drinks and fast food consumption) were negatively associated with self-reported health, happiness and sleep satisfaction. Positive dietary behaviours (regular breakfast, fruit, vegetable, and milk consumption) were negatively associated with perceived stress and depression symptoms. Unhealthy dietary behaviours (consumption of fast food, caffeine, sweetened drinks and soft drinks) were associated with perceived stress and depression symptoms. Conclusions: The study found strong cross-sectional evidence that healthy dietary behaviours were associated with lower mental distress and higher psychological well-being. It remains unclear, if a healthier dietary behaviour is the cause or the sequela of a more positive well-being. © 2017 The Author(s).",,academic achievement; adolescent; age distribution; Article; body mass; coffee; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; dietary intake; female; food intake; fruit; happiness; health survey; high school student; human; Korea; major clinical study; male; meal; mental stress; milk; physical activity; priority journal; psychological well-being; questionnaire; self report; sex ratio; social status; soft drink; substance use; vegetable,Article

Phthalates is known to be one of the EDCs and have estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities, and may be associated with advanced puberty. The objective of the study was to determine the association between urinary phthalate metabolites and advanced puberty. A cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with precocious puberty (breast onset <8 years, n=42) and early puberty (breast onset 8-9 years, n=17), compared to age-matched controls (n=77). Anthropometric measurements, estradiol, basal and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, uterine sizes, ovarian diameters and bone ages (BA) were obtained. Urine samples were collected and mono-methyl phthalate (MMP) and mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and adjusted with urine creatinine. The median adjusted-MEP concentration in girls with precocious puberty, was greater than in normal girls (6105.09 vs. 4633.98 μg/g Cr: p<0.05), and had the same trend among early puberty and normal puberty (5141.41 vs. 4633.98 μg/g Cr: p=0.4), but was not statistically significant. Precocious puberty girls had an association with increased MEP concentration.

Methods: AS-PCR for JAK2 V617F, pyrosequencing for MPL W515L/K, and PCR-fragment analysis for CALR exon 9 mutations were established to analyze genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples of 58 newly diagnosed ET patients in Thailand. Results:JAK2 V617F was detected in 41 patients (71%) and CALR exon 9 mutation was positive in eight patients (14%), whereas no mutation of MPL W515L/K was observed in this study. Patients with CALR mutation were older (p = 0.023) and exhibited lower number of platelet count (p = 0.041) than patients without CALR mutation. Two previously known CALR mutation types were identified in this study (six patients with CALR-type 1 and two patients with CALR-type 2). Additionally, no co-existence of JAK2 V617F and CALR mutations was identified in this work. Conclusion: We reported the frequency of JAK2 V617F, MPL W515L/K, and CALR mutations in Thai patients with ET. Clinical and hematological phenotypes of patients were associated with JAK2 and CALR mutation statuses.

For national malaria control programmes in the region, it is important to establish a surveillance system which includes monitoring for k13 polymorphisms associated with the clinical phenotype. Methods: Between February and December 2013, parasite clearance was assessed in 35 patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum treated with artesunate monotherapy followed by 3-day ACT in an isolated area on the Myanmar-Thai border with relatively low artemisinin drug pressure. Molecular testing for k13 mutations was performed on dry blood spots collected on admission. Results: The proportion of k13 mutations in these patients was 41.7%, and only 5 alleles were detected: C580Y, I205T, M476I, R561H, and F446I. Of these, F446I was the most common, and was associated with a longer parasite clearance half-life (median) 4.1 (min-max 2.3-6.7) hours compared to 2.5 (min-max 1.6-8.7) in wildtype (p = 0·01). The prevalence of k13 mutant parasites was much lower than the proportion of k13 mutants detected 200 km south in a much less remote setting where the prevalence of k13 mutants was 84% with 15 distinct alleles in 2013 of which C580Y predominated. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of artemisinin resistance in a remote part of eastern Myanmar. The prevalence of k13 mutations as well as allele diversity varies considerably across short distances, presumably because of historical patterns of artemisinin use and population movements. © 2017 The Author(s).",Artemisinin; Drug resistance; k13 mutation; Parasite clearance; Plasmodium falciparum malaria,artemisinin; artesunate; adolescent; allele; antibiotic resistance; antiparasitic therapy; Article; child; chromosome 13; clinical article; clinical trial; dried blood spot testing; drug safety; female; gene mutation; genotype; half life time; human; Kelch gene; malaria falciparum; male; microbial gene; monotherapy; Myanmar; nonhuman; parasite clearance; Plasmodium falciparum; prevalence; treatment response; wild type,Article

The mechanism of SSL/TLS relies on a key pair to validate the server and to protect the confidentiality of the data. However, many websites are running on third-party servers or on cloud environments where website owners have no control over the physical servers or the software including the operating systems but still need to trust and store the private key on the servers. While it is common to store the encrypted key on the disk, the web server still need a decrypted key inside the memory during the operation. Thus, an adversary could obtain the private key residing on the web server's memory.

Although early diagnosis and surgery are the best predictors of treatment response, current diagnostic approaches are imprecise and time-consuming. We used large-scale, quantitative serum proteomics at the time of diagnosis of biliary atresia and other cholestatic syndromes (serving as disease controls) to identify biomarkers of disease. In a discovery cohort of 70 subjects, the lead biomarker wasmatrixmetalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7),which retained high distinguishing features for biliary atresia in two validation cohorts. Notably, the diagnostic performance reached 95% when MMP-7 was combined with g-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), a marker of cholestasis. Using human tissue and an experimental model of biliary atresia, we found that MMP-7 is primarily expressed by cholangiocytes, released upon epithelial injury, and promotes the experimental disease phenotype. Thus, we propose that serum MMP-7 (alone or in combination with GGT) is a diagnostic biomarker for biliary atresia and may serve as a therapeutic target. © 2017 The Authors.",,gamma glutamyltransferase; matrilysin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bile duct atresia; cholangiocyte; cholestasis; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; epithelial injury; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; infant; liver fibrosis; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; phenotype; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein analysis; protein blood level; protein expression; proteomics; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); tissue injury; validation process,Article

The method employs the membraneless vaporization (MBL-VP) technique for gas-sample separation allowing direct analysis of wine. Sulfite in an aliquot of sample was converted to SO2 gas via acidification. Dissolution of the gas into the water acceptor led to a change in the conductivity of the acceptor which was monitored using a 'capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector' (C4D) flow cell. Only a minute amount of common acid (100 μL of 1.5 mol L-1 H2SO4) is used. The MBL-VP unit was incorporated into the flow system to separate the SO2 gas from the wine sample using the headspace above the donor and acceptor compartments as a virtual membrane. The method provides a linear working range (10-200 mg L-1 sulfite) which is suitable for most wines with calibration equation y = (0.056 ± 0.002)x + (1.10 ± 0.22) and r2 = 0.998. Sample throughput is 26 samples h-1. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ = 3SD of blank per slope) is 0.3 mg L-1 sulfite for 20 s diffusion time with good precision (%RSD = 0.8 for 100 mg L-1 sulfite, n = 10). We also present a simple modification of the MBL-VP unit by the addition of a third cone-shaped reservoir to provide two acceptor zones leading to improvement in sensitivity of more than three-fold without use of heating to enhance the rate of diffusion of SO2. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Wine; Calibration equations; Capacitively coupled; Contactless conductivity detection; Contactless conductivity detector; Donor and acceptor; Gas-liquid separation; Lower limit of quantitations; Simple modifications; Gases,Article

The disease burden is significantly underestimated, especially the prevalence of Leishmania infection among HIV-positive patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with Leishmania infection among patients with HIV/AIDS living in Trang province, southern Thailand, between 2015 and 2016. Antibodies against Leishmania infection were assayed using the direct agglutination test (DAT). DNA of Leishmania was detected by ITS1-PCR using the buffy coat. Species of Leishmania were also identified. Results: Of 724 participants, the prevalence of Leishmania infection was 25.1% (182/724) using either DAT and/or PCR assays. Seroprevalence of Leishmania infection was 18.5% (134/724), while Leishmania DNA detected by the PCR method was 8.4% (61/724). Of these, 24.9% (180/724) were asymptomatic, whereas 0.3% (2/724) were symptomatic VL and VL/CL (cutaneous leishmaniosis). At least five species were identified: L siamensis, L. martiniquensis, L. donovani complex, L. lainsoni, and L. major. Multivariate analysis showed that CD4+levels &lt;500 cells/μL and living in stilt houses were independently associated with Leishmania infection. Those who were PCR positive for Leishmania DNA were significantly associated with a detectable viral load, whereas non-injection drug use (NIDU) and CD4+levels &lt;500 cells/μL were potential risk factors of Leishmania seropositivity. Conclusions: A magnitude of the prevalence of underreporting Leishmania infection among Thai patients with HIV was revealed in this study.

However, sporadic autochthonous malaria outbreaks do occur. In one of the most recent outbreaks of vivax malaria, an entomological investigation identified Anopheles sinensis as the most probable vector. As metaphase karyotype studies divided An. sinensis into two forms, A and B, with different vector competence: the investigation of vector competence of An. sinensis found in Singapore was thus pursued using Plasmodium vivax field isolates from the Thailand-Myanmar border. Methods: Adults and larvae An. sinensis were collected from Singapore from 14 different locations, using various trapping and collection methods between September 2013 and January 2016. Molecular identification of An. sinensis species were conducted by amplifying the ITS2 and CO1 region using PCR. Experimental infections of An. sinensis using blood from seven patients infected with P. vivax from the Thailand-Myanmar border were conducted with Anopheles cracens (An. dirus B) as control. Results: Phylogenetic analysis showed that An. sinensis (F22, F2 and collected from outbreak areas) found in Singapore was entirely Form A, and closely related to An. sinensis Form A from Thailand. Artificial infection of these Singapore strain An. sinensis Form A resulted in the development of oocysts in four experiments, with the number of sporozoites produced by one An. sinensis ranging from 4301 to 14,538. Conclusions: Infection experiments showed that An. sinensis Form A from Singapore was susceptible to Thai-Myanmar P. vivax strain, suggesting a potential role as a malaria vector in Singapore. © 2017 The Author(s).",An. cracens; Anopheles sinensis Form A; Infection; Malaria vector; Sporozoites,internal transcribed spacer 2; adult; Anopheles; Anopheles cracens; Anopheles dirus; Anopheles sinensis; Article; clinical article; COI gene; controlled study; female; gene; genetic association; genetic susceptibility; human; informed consent; ITS2 gene; larva; male; Myanmar; nonhuman; oocyst; parasite identification; phylogeny; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; real time polymerase chain reaction; Singapore; sporozoite; Thailand,Article

However, the effect of factors on students self-directed learning and conceptual understanding progression is not explored yet. According to the developed web-based learning environment, this study choose pedagogy and formative assessment as important factors in promoting self-directed learning and increasing conceptual understanding. Our results suggest that scientific inquiry learning with relevance to daily life, with corresponding to individual characteristics, and with formative assessment affecting self-directed learning and conceptual understanding progression gained by a personalized web-based learning environment. © 2017 IEEE.",Digital learning communities; Evaluation of web-based learning systems; Individual differences in education; Secondary education,Computer aided instruction; Education; Learning systems; Students; Websites; Conceptual understanding; Digital-learning; Educational organizations; Individual characteristics; Individual Differences; Personal learning environment; Web-based learning environment; Web-based learning systems; E-learning,Conference Paper

The purpose of this study was to describe and quantify kinematic patterns of the pelvis and trunk using a dynamics systems approach, and determine agreement between clinical observation and kinematic classification. Method: Ninety-eight subjects performed repeated forward bending with clinical observation and kinematic data simultaneously collected. Kinematic data were plotted using angle-angle, coupling-angle, and phase-plane diagrams. Accuracy statistics in conjunction with receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine agreement between clinical observation and kinematic patterns. Results: Kinematic patterns were consistent with clinical observation and definitions of typical and aberrant movement patterns with moderate agreement (kappa = 0.46-0.50; PABAK = 0.49-0.73). Early pelvic motion dominance in lumbopelvic coupling-angle diagram ≥59° within the first 38% of the movement represent observed altered lumbopelvic rhythm. Frequent disruptions in lumbar spine velocity represented by phase-plane diagrams with local minimum occurrences ≥6 and sudden decoupling in lumbopelvic coupling-angle diagrams with sum of local minimum and maximum occurrences ≥15 represent observed judder. Conclusion: These findings further define observations of movement coordination between the pelvis and lumbar spine for the presence of altered lumbopelvic rhythm and judder. Movement quality of the lumbar spine segment is key to identifying judder. This information will help clinicians better understand and identify aberrant movement patterns in patients with non-specific low back pain. © 2017 The Author(s).",Aberrant movement patterns; Clinical observation; Low back pain; Multi-segment kinematics,adult; aged; Article; body movement; clinical observation; controlled study; coordination; cross-sectional study; female; human; kinematics; low back pain; lumbar spine; male; measurement accuracy; pelvis; receiver operating characteristic; trunk,Article

This change should be reflected in patterns of tree and crown allometries, stand demography and community composition. Empirical tests of these predictions have largely concentrated on temperate forests. Here, we ask whether these expectations also hold in tropical forests. We established eight permanent inventory plots of different ages in a tropical forest in Thailand, and measured dbh, crown architecture and community composition. We then tested whether differences in (1) allometries, (2) size structure, (3) stand structure and (4) community composition between plots are consistent with expectations from succession theory. In particular, we tested if tree and stand patterns conform to the expectation that competition intensity is highest during intermediate development stages, and that species specialize into particular successional niches. We find that the empirical patterns in the plots are compatible with both assumptions. Observed dbh-height and crown allometries, as well as stand attributes, suggest that trees respond to denser packing in the intermediate development stage (stem exclusion stage) by increased investments in height growth, presumably because of strong resource competition, particularly for light. Packing and competition seems less pronounced in earlier and later stages. An analysis of community composition shows that species composition clustered with development stages, suggesting a specialization into successional niches. In conclusion, stand attributes of the tropical plots used in this study largely conform to the predictions of forest stand development theories that have so far mainly been tested in temperate forests. We did not find evidence for qualitative differences between tropical and temperate stand development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Allometry; Competition; Crown architecture; Secondary forest; Southeast Asia; Succession,Biology; Competition; Ecology; Structure (composition); Tropics; Allometry; Crown architecture; Secondary forests; Southeast Asia; Succession; Forestry; allometry; canopy architecture; community composition; community structure; competition (ecology); demography; forest inventory; plant community; secondary forest; stand structure; succession; temperate forest; tree; tropical forest; Forests; Packing; Southeast Asia; Thailand,Article

Index of Learning Style (ILS) has widely been used to identify students learning style and to provide learning suggestions accordingly; unfortunately, question items are presented in text-based format, in which students may simply give responses without any careful considerations or misinterpret the questions. This could lead to misidentify their learning styles and to provide inappropriate learning tasks/activities to their preferences. Therefore, this study proposes an alternative instrument to diagnose students learning style with an interactive story-based mobile game application based on ILS. Students can interact with the scenario-based story in the game with enjoyment; meanwhile, they can make decisions by giving responses on the quest items through different situations. The quests were carefully designed and validated to ensure similar measurement to the original ILS items. Furthermore, an experiment has been conducted to evaluate its effectiveness. The findings showed that all quest items on the proposed game application are effective and reliable to diagnose students learning style and to suggest practical learning tasks/activities accordingly in lesser time in order to enhance their learning performance. In addition, students were highly satisfied and strongly accepted this novel tool; therefore, this novel game can be used as an alternative to the original ILS. © 2017 IEEE.",Educational game; ILS; Learning diagnostic; Learning style; Mobile learning,Students; Educational game; Improving learning; Interactive stories; Learning diagnostic; Learning performance; Learning Style; Mobile Learning; Students learning; Education,Conference Paper

Methodology A cross-sectional survey using a 36-item questionnaire was conducted among country representatives to AOAN from August 2015 to August 2016. Results A total of 18/20 AOAN member countries participated in the survey. All the countries have organized association with regular meetings, election of officers and neurology training program. In 9/18 countries, professionals other than neurologists were eligible for affiliation. In 11/18 countries, prior Internal medicine training (or equivalent postgraduate housemanship) is prerequisite to neurology program. Recertification examination is not a practice, but submission of CME is required in 7/18 countries to maintain membership. 12/18 countries publish peer-reviewed journals with at least 1 issue per year. Subspecialty training is offered in 14/18 countries. The ratio of neurologist to population ranges from 1:14,000 to as low as 1:32 million with 9/18 having < 1 neurologist per 100,000 population. 6/18 countries have at least 1 specialized center solely for neurological diseases. In government-funded hospitals, the lag time to be seen by a neurologist and/or obtain neuroimaging scan ranges from 1 day to 3 months. All except one country have several medical- and lay- advocacy or support groups for different neurological conditions. Implications The data generated can be used for benchmarking to improve neurological care, training, collaborative work and research in the field of neurosciences among the AOAN member countries. The paper presented several strategies used by the different organizations to increase their number of neurologists and improve the quality of training.

Uncertainty remains about the appropriate dose of aspirin for adenoma prevention. The persistence of the protective effect of NSAIDs against recurrent adenomas after treatment cessation is yet to be established. Methods: Our objective was to update and systematically evaluate the evidence for aspirin and other NSAIDs on the incidence of recurrent colorectal adenomas taking into consideration the risks of random error and to appraise the quality of evidence using GRADE (The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Retrieved trials were evaluated using Cochrane risk of bias instrument. Meta-analytic estimates were calculated with random-effects model and random errors were evaluated with trial sequential analysis (TSA). Results: In patients with a previous history of colorectal cancer or adenomas, low-dose aspirin (80-160 mg/day) compared to placebo taken for 2 to 4 years reduces the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas (relative risk (RR), 0.80 [95% CI (confidence interval), 0.70-0.92]). TSA indicated a firm evidence for this beneficial effect. The evidence indicated moderate GRADE quality. Low-dose aspirin also reduces the recurrence of advanced adenomas (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.44-0.99]); however, TSA indicated lack of firm evidence for a beneficial effect. High-dose aspirin (300-325 mg/day) did not statistically reduce the recurrent adenomas (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.68-1.18]). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib 400 mg/day) were associated with a significant decrease in the recurrence of both adenomas (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.59-0.72]) and advanced adenomas (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.33-0.57]); however, this association did not persist and there was a trend of an increased risk of recurrent adenomas observed 2 years after the withdrawal. Conclusion: Our findings confirm the beneficial effect of low-dose aspirin on recurrence of any adenomas; however, effect on advanced adenomas was inconclusive. COX-2 inhibitors seem to be more effective in preventing recurrence of adenomas; however, there was a trend of an increased risk of recurrence of adenomas observed after discontinuing regular use. © 2017 The Author(s).","Anti-inflammatory agents, Non-steroidal; Aspirin; Colorectal adenomas; Meta-analysis; Randomized controlled trials; Systematic review; Trial sequential analysis",acetylsalicylic acid; celecoxib; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; placebo; rofecoxib; Article; cancer recurrence; clinical evaluation; colorectal adenoma; disease association; drug effect; drug monitoring; follow up; health care quality; human; incidence; low drug dose; meta analysis; random error; recurrence risk; risk factor; risk reduction; systematic error; systematic review; tumor volume,Article

The National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) targeted migrant workers based mainly on the stability of their worksites (categories 1: permanent work-setting; categories 2 and 3: less stable work-settings). This study aims to assess the migration patterns, malaria treatment-seeking preferences, and challenges encountered by mobile/migrant workers at remote sites in a malaria-elimination setting. Methods: A mixed-methods explanatory sequential study retrospectively analysed the secondary data acquired through migrant mapping surveys (2013-2015) in six endemic regions (n = 9603). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to ascertain the contributing factors. A qualitative strand (2016-2017) was added by conducting five focus-group discussions (n = 50) and five in-depth interviews with migrant workers from less stable worksites in Shwegyin Township, Bago Region. The contiguous approach was used to integrate quantitative and qualitative findings. Results: Among others, migrant workers from Bago Region were significantly more likely to report the duration of stay ≥ 12 months (63% vs. 49%) and high seasonal mobility (40% vs. 35%). Particularly in less stable settings, a very low proportion of migrant workers (17%) preferred to seek malaria treatment from the public sector and was significantly influenced by the worksite stability (adjusted OR = 1.4 and 2.3, respectively for categories 2 and 1); longer duration of stay (adjusted OR = 3.5); and adjusted OR < 2 for received malaria messages, knowledge of malaria symptoms and awareness of means of malaria diagnosis. Qualitative data further elucidated their preference for the informal healthcare sector, due to convenience, trust and good relations, and put migrant workers at risk of substandard care. Moreover, the availability of cheap anti-malarial in unregistered small groceries encouraged self-medication. Infrequent or no contact with rural health centres and voluntary health workers worsened the situation. Conclusions: Mitigating key drivers that favour poor utilization of public-sector services among highly mobile migrant workers in less stable work-settings should be given priority in a malaria-elimination setting. These issues are challenging for the NMCP in Myanmar and might be generalized to other countries in the GMS to achieve malaria-elimination goals. Further innovative out-reach programmes designed and implemented specific to the nature of mobile/migrant workers is crucial. © 2017 The Author(s).",GMS; Malaria elimination; Migrant workers; Mixed-methods design; Myanmar; Public sector; Rural health centers; Voluntary health workers,antimalarial agent; adult; Article; attitude to illness; awareness; controlled study; endemic disease; female; health care; health care personnel; health care utilization; help seeking behavior; human; interview; malaria; male; migrant worker; Myanmar; patient preference; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; rural health care; season; self medication; symptom; work environment,Article

Religious piety alleviates the agency conflict by lessening the motivation for managers to exploit shareholders. Because of its role in mitigating the agency conflict, we argue that religious piety influences corporate governance arrangements. We exploit the variation in religious piety across U.S. counties and show that religious piety significantly influences the probability that a firm has an entrenched (staggered) board of directors. In particular, firms located in an area with stronger religious piety are significantly less likely to have a staggered board. This negative effect, however, is significant only when the degree of religiosity is higher than a certain threshold. Further analysis reveals that our results are unlikely confounded by endogeneity. Our results are especially interesting as they demonstrate that non-financial attributes, such as religious piety, has a significant influence on one of the most crucial governance mechanisms, i.e. the board of directors. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",agency conflict; agency theory; classified boards; entrenched boards; piety; Religion; staggered boards,management practice; religion; stakeholder; theoretical study; United States,Article

In this study, we consider sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as our dependent variables. Our key independent variables are FDI and trade. Our study finds evidence that foreign investment and trade have had a negative impact on our selected emissions. However, our models also estimate turning points which are below the current GDP per capita values for all CAFTA-DR member countries. This is an encouraging trend in terms of the potential reduction in emissions in the region. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",CAFTA-DR; Environmental Kuznets’ Curve (EKC); environmental quality; FDI; trade,emission control; environmental economics; environmental quality; foreign direct investment; free trade; international trade; Kuznets curve; Dominican Republic; Hispaniola,Article

Although resistance mechanisms of ESCs have extensively been studied, the proteome-wide investigation on the biological response to the antibiotic stress is still limited. Herein, a proteomics approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis was applied to investigate the global protein expression under ESC stresses of ESC-susceptible and ESCreduced susceptible N. gonorrhoeae strains. Upon exposure to ceftriaxone, 14 and 21 proteins of ESCsusceptible and ESC-reduced susceptible strains, respectively, were shown to be differentially expressed. In the meanwhile, differential expressions of 13 and 17 proteins were detected under cefixime stress for ESCsusceptible and ESC-reduced susceptible strains, respectively. ESC antibiotics have been proven to trigger the expression of several proteins implicated in a variety of biological functions including transport system, energy metabolism, stress response and pathogenic virulence factors. Interestingly, macrophage infectivity potentiators (Ng-MIP) showed increased expression for ESC-reduced susceptible strain under ESC stress. The altered expression of Ng-MIP was found to be a unique response to ESC stresses. Our finding proposes a broad view on proteomic changes in N. gonorrhoeae in response to ESC antibiotics that provides further insights into the gonococcal antimicrobial resistance and physiological adaptation mechanism. © 2017, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors.

Similarly, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been proposed to be a key driver of tumor metastasis. However, the link between the two events and their control mechanisms is unclear. We used a three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid assay and other CSCindicating assays to investigate the role of E-cadherin in CSC regulation and its association to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cells. Ectopic overexpression and knockdown of E-cadherin were found to promote and retard, respectively, the formation of tumor spheroids in vitro but had opposite effects on tumor formation and metastasis in vivo in a xenograft mouse model. We explored the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results and demonstrated, for the first time, that E-cadherin is required as a component of a major survival pathway under detachment conditions. Downregulation of E-cadherin increased the stemness of lung cancer cells but had an adverse effect on their survival, particularly on non-CSCs. Such downregulation also promoted anoikis resistance and invasiveness of lung cancer cells. These results suggest that anoikis assay could be used as an alternative method for in vitro assessment of CSCs that involves dysregulated adhesion proteins. Our data also suggest that agents that restore E-cadherin expression may be used as therapeutic agents for metastatic cancers. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.",Anoikis; Cancer stem cell; E-cadherin; Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; Lung cancer; Metastasis; Tumor formation,"aldehyde dehydrogenase; CD133 antigen; Hermes antigen; nerve cell adhesion molecule; transcription factor ZEB1; uvomorulin; vimentin; cadherin; CDH1 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; anoikis; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer stem cell; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell survival; controlled study; down regulation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; metastasis; mouse; NCI-H460 cell line; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; signal transduction; tumor spheroid; animal; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; nonobese diabetic mouse; pathology; physiology; SCID mouse; tumor cell line; xenograft; Animals; Anoikis; Cadherins; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Heterografts; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Neoplastic Stem Cells",Article

Markers of resistance to a wide panel of antimalarials were assessed in natural parasite populations from southwestern Cameroon. Methods: Individuals with asymptomatic parasitaemia or uncomplicated malaria were enrolled through cross-sectional surveys from May 2013 to March 2014 along the slope of mount Cameroon. Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasitaemic blood, screened by light microscopy, was depleted of leucocytes using CF11 cellulose columns and the parasite genotype ascertained by sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Results: A total of 259 participants were enrolled in this study from three different altitudes. While some alleles associated with drug resistance in pfdhfr, pfmdr1 and pfcrt were highly prevalent, less than 3% of all samples carried mutations in the pfkelch13 gene, none of which were amongst those associated with slow artemisinin parasite clearance rates in Southeast Asia. The most prevalent haplotypes were triple mutants Pfdhfr I 51 R 59 N 108 I 164(99%), pfcrt- C72V73 I 74 E 75 T 76 (47.3%), and single mutants PfdhpsS436 G 437K540A581A613(69%) and Pfmdr1 N86 F 184D1246 (53.2%). Conclusions: The predominance of the Pf pfcrt CVIET and Pf dhfr IRN triple mutant parasites and absence of pfkelch13 resistance alleles suggest that the amodiaquine and pyrimethamine components of AS-AQ and SP may no longer be effective in their role while chloroquine resistance still persists in southwestern Cameroon. © 2017 The Author(s).",Drug resistance; Molecular markers; Plasmodium falciparum,artemisinin; insecticide; molecular marker; allele; antibiotic resistance; Article; Cameroon; cross-sectional study; DNA extraction; female; gene mutation; gene sequence; genotype; haplotype; human; malaria; male; nonhuman; pfcrt gene; pfdhfr gene; pfmdr1 gene; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal,Article

A study was conducted to assess the malaria incidence in forest rangers and the feasibility of malaria prophylaxis for rangers sleeping in forest camps. Methods: Forest rangers deployed in the Bu Gia Map National Park, Vietnam were invited to participate in the study. Plasmodium infections were cleared using presumptive treatment, irrespective of malaria status, with a 3-day course dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (DP) and a 14-day course of primaquine. Before returning to the forest, study participants were randomly allocated to a 3-day course of DP or placebo. Fifteen days after returning from their forest deployment the participants were tested for Plasmodium infections using uPCR. Results: Prior to treatment, 30 of 150 study participants (20%) were found to be infected with Plasmodium. Seventeen days (median) after enrolment the rangers were randomized to DP or placebo 2 days before returning to forest camps where they stayed between 2 and 20 days (median 9.5 days). One ranger in the DP-prophylaxis arm and one in the placebo arm were found to be infected with Plasmodium falciparum 15 days (median) after returning from the forest. The evaluable P. falciparum isolates had molecular markers indicating resistance to artemisinins (K13-C580Y) and piperaquine (plasmepsin), but none had multiple copies of pfmdr1 associated with mefloquine resistance. Conclusion: Anti-malarial prophylaxis in forest rangers is feasible. The findings of the study highlight the threat of multidrug-resistant malaria.

There has been limited research towards gaining a comprehensive understanding of survivorship care provision in the Asia-Pacific region. This study aimed to establish the perceptions of responsibility, confidence, and frequency of survivorship care practices of oncology practitioners and examine their perspectives on factors that impede quality survivorship care. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of hospital-based oncology practitioners in 10 Asia-Pacific countries was undertaken between May 2015-October 2016. The participating countries included Australia, Hong Kong, China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, India, Myanmar, and The Philippines. The survey was administered using paper-based or online questionnaires via specialist cancer care settings, educational meetings, and professional organisations. Results: In total, 1501 oncology practitioners participated in the study. When comparing the subscales of responsibility perception, frequency and confidence, Australian practitioners had significantly higher ratings than practitioners in Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, and Singapore (all p < 0.05). Surprisingly, practitioners working in Low- and Mid- Income Countries (LMICs) had higher levels of responsibility perception, confidence and frequencies of delivering survivorship care than those working in High-Income Countries (HICs) (p < 0.001), except for the responsibility perception of care coordination where no difference in scores was observed (p = 0.83). Physicians were more confident in delivering most of the survivorship care interventions compared to nurses and allied-health professionals. Perceived barriers to survivorship care were similar across the HICs and LMICs, with the most highly rated items for all practitioners being lack of time, dedicated educational resources for patients and family members, and evidence-based practice guidelines informing survivorship care. Conclusions: Different survivorship practices have been observed between HICs and LMICs, Australia and other countries and between the professional disciplines. Future service planning and research efforts should take these findings into account and overcome barriers identified in this study. © 2017 The Author(s).",Asia-Pacific region; Barriers; Cancer survivorship; Health professionals; Oncology practitioner; Perspectives; Practice patterns,adult; Article; Australia; cancer survivor; China; controlled study; cross-sectional study; evidence based practice; female; health care delivery; health care quality; health personnel attitude; Hong Kong; human; India; Japan; male; medical practice; Myanmar; nurse attitude; oncologist; paramedical personnel; Philippines; physician attitude; practice guideline; questionnaire; Singapore; South Korea; Thailand,Article

Most patients (73%) received the treatment including multiple-dose activated charcoal (67.5%), intravenous N-acetylcysteine (87.5%), and benzylpenicillin (45%). In 60% of the cases, the treatment was initiated within 24 h after eating mushrooms. Exchange transfusion and liver transplantation were performed in one severe case. However, this patient died eventually. Because intravenous silybinin is not available in Thailand during the study period, 8 patients received oral silymarin instead. All 8 patients had hepatitis and were treated with high dosage of oral silymarin (5 patients with 4.48 g/day, 2 patients with 1.68 g/day, and 1 patient with 1.4 g/day) for a couple of days. One of these patients died as she received treatment very late; she was treated with silymarin at 1.68 g/day dosage. Thus, the fatality in oral silymarin treatment group was 12.5%. We performed the analysis between the dead and survival groups. We found that in hepatitis, initial and maximum serum aspartate transaminase, initial and maximum serum alanine transaminase, and acute kidney injury were significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Amanita mushroom poisoning caused high fatalities. Serum transaminase and creatinine were the factors associated with death. Treatment with oral high dose silymarin should be investigated further as one of the principal therapies in amatoxin poisoning. © 2017 Trakulsrichai et al.",Amatoxin; Clinical characteristic; Outcome; Silymarin; Treatment,acetylcysteine; activated carbon; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; creatinine; penicillin G; silymarin; acute kidney failure; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Amanita; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; blood clotting disorder; cause of death; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; creatinine blood level; disease severity; drug megadose; exchange blood transfusion; fatality; female; hepatitis; hospitalization; human; jaundice; length of stay; liver transplantation; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; mushroom poisoning; retrospective study; time to treatment,Article

The collective responsibility to advocate food security and sustaining the farming system is a key issue. While the conventional farming techniques have combated to meet global food demands, however sustaining food security to provide access to safe and nutritious food is at probable risk to the growing population. At present, people are concerned more on the importance of diet and health since easily available inorganic farm products give threats to people's health by triggering unsolicited diseases. Organic farming is an approach that would guarantee environmental friendly, sustainable and safe nutritious foods with low impact to the soil biodiversity. One of the main challenging dispute of organic farming is the low yield as compared to rapid inorganic farming methods. To increase organic farm produce yield, monitoring soil organic abundance plays a key role in organic farming system. To uncover this issue, a real time smart electronic system was designed to monitor soil organic richness online in the farm to support farmers in making informed decision. The system was capable of archiving real time soil data based on soil organic volatile. Software application were integrated to analyze soil data and display soil information online including weather parameters in line with the soil status. Base station installed in the farm transmitted soil data to the control station for analysis and uploading data into a cloud database for end user's information. Data were analyzed by principal component analysis to grade organic abundance in soil and linear discriminate analysis to segregate soil volatile variation. © 2017 IEEE.",elecitronic nose; food security; organic abundance; organic farming; soil VOCs,Agriculture; Application programs; Biodiversity; Climate change; Electronic nose; Food supply; Global warming; Health risks; Principal component analysis; Sensory aids; Soils; Collective responsibility; elecitronic nose; Environmental-friendly; Food security; Linear discriminate analysis; organic abundance; Organic farming; Organic farming system; Monitoring,Conference Paper

For this reason, we have developed an electronic nose based on eight metal oxide gas sensors in this work to functional as a system that can analyze urine odor. To evaluate the performance of gas sensors, we have performed tests from three groups of urine obtained from healthy, diabetic and alcohol-drinking volunteers. Representatively, the highest sensing response was found to be demonstrated by the sensor TGS2603 and the lowest by MQ8. Overall, all the gas sensors have shown excellent sensitivity to the changes in the urine odor.

Other subsites of HNCA with less known association to HPV have never been studied in Thailand. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HPV DNA in hypopharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in Thai population. Methods: This cross-sectional study included hypopharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients diagnosed and treated at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Siriraj Hospital during the September 2011-December 2013 study period. Presence of HPV genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction from pathologically-confirmed fresh specimens. Demographic data and risk factors of HPV infection were evaluated. Results: Eighty patients were included, and 95% of those were male. Only one patient was noted with positive HPV-62 serotype. Most patients consumed tobacco and/or alcohol. Five patients had no risk factors for cancer development. Risk of HPV infection was evaluated by self-reporting questionnaire. The mean age of sexual debut was 20.17 years. Forty-eight patients had multiple sexual partners. Sixteen and seven patients had history of sexually transmitted disease infection and habitual oral sex contact, respectively. Conclusion: There was no oncogenic HPV DNA detected within pathologic specimens of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers in this study.

The chronic infection of O. viverrini is related to cholangiocarcinoma which causes high mortality in endemic areas. Therefore, the diagnosis, treatment, control and prevention of O. viverrini infection are necessary. The morphology of the egg is very similar to that of other species of human liver flukes (Opisthorchis felineus and Clonorchis sinensis) as well as that of small intestinal flukes in the family Heterophyidae. Thus, molecular characterization is crucially required to discriminate species of Opisthorchis-like eggs in fecal examination. Methodology/Principal findings: We aimed to determine the prevalence of O. viverrini infection among villagers living in Sanamchaikate District, Chachoengsao Province, in central Thailand, where O. viverrini infection has previously been reported. A total of 2,609 fecal samples were examined for Opisthorchis-like eggs using microscopic examination. PCR-RFLP analysis of the ITS2 region was used to discriminate Opisthorchis-like eggs. The genetic structure of O. viverrini infection was demonstrated using nucleotide sequencing of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1). Testing of evolutionary neutrality of the cox1 and nad1 sequences of O. viverrini was performed using Tajima's D tests and Fu's Fs tests. Moreover, the haplotype networks and phylogenetic trees were constructed to study the relationships of O. viverrini isolated from different endemic areas. A high prevalence of O. viverrini infection is still observed in a rural community of Chachoengsao Province, central Thailand. The overall prevalence of Opisthorchis-like eggs using microscopic examination was 16.8%. PCR-RFLP profiles showed the predominant infection of O. viverrini (9.6%) including very low infections of other small intestinal flukes, Haplorchis taichui (0.08%) and Euparyphium albuferensis (0.08%). The genetic structure of O. viverrini populations in central Thailand was also described and revealed a non-significant difference in genetic diversity. In addition, the genetic background of the O. viverrini populations was closely related to the isolate from Lao PDR. Conclusions/Significance: Our study highlighted the prevalence of O. viverrini infection in central Thailand indicating that control programs and health education regarding opisthorchiasis is still required in this endemic area. Additionally, the study demonstrated the genetic structure of O. viverrini, in central Thailand which could provide information on the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. © 2017 Buathong et al.",,"cytochrome c oxidase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, human; NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, human; Article; Clonorchis sinensis; DNA extraction; egg; Euparyphium albuferensis; feces analysis; gene structure; genetic screening; genetic variability; Haplorchis taichui; haplotype; microscopy; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; Opisthorchis viverrini; phylogenetic tree; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; restriction fragment length polymorphism; rural population; trematode; animal; classification; complication; cross-sectional study; feces; genetic variation; genetics; human; isolation and purification; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; ovum; parasitology; phylogeny; Thailand; ultrastructure; Animals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Electron Transport Complex IV; Feces; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Humans; NADH Dehydrogenase; Opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; Ovum; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Prevalence; Rural Population; Thailand",Article

Buttock claudication occurred in only nine (20%) of the embolization patients (9/49 IIA’s) (p =.14), while one IIA-related type II endoleak, occurred in the nonembolization group (p =.16). In patients with IIAA(s), the aneurysm diameter decreased in 16 cases (67%). Buttock claudication occurred in 75% of bilateral, and in 14.6% of unilateral embolizations (p =.046). Conclusions: Carefully selected patients with aortoiliac aneurysm without IIAA may safely undergo hypogastric artery overstenting without preemptive embolization during EVAR. IIA embolization is associated with buttock claudication and should be avoided if possible. Otherwise, at least one IIA should be preserved. © 2017 Society of Medical Innovation and Technology.",buttock claudication; common iliac artery aneurysm; embolization; endoleak; EVAR; internal iliac artery aneurysm; stent-graft,adult; aged; artery occlusion; Article; artificial embolization; claudication; clinical outcome; controlled study; endoleak; endovascular aneurysm repair; endovascular aortic aneurysm repair; female; human; hypogastric artery occlusion; internal iliac artery; major clinical study; male; priority journal; thrombosis,Article

Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. From the University of British Columbia Orbit Clinic between January 1976 and December 2008, we reviewed the medical records of 60 patients who presented with inflammatory features of the lacrimal gland (i.e., erythema, edema, or tenderness) in which the diagnoses were not possible clinically and on imaging alone. As was our routine practice, all these patients underwent lacrimal gland biopsy before starting any treatment. Results: The histopathologic findings of the 60 patients showed that 37 (61.7%) had identifiable types of lacrimal inflammation including 10 with Sjogren’s syndrome, seven with sarcoidal reaction, six with feature of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis), five with lymphoma, two with sclerosing inflammation, two with IgG4-related dacryoadenitis, and one patient each with infectious dacryoadenitis, myoepithelial carcinoma, xanthogranuloma, eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis, and eosinophilic allergic granulomatous nodule. The histopathologic findings of the remaining 23 (38.3%) patients showed nonspecific inflammation of the lacrimal gland. 23 patients (38.3%) had associated systemic diseases. 48 patients (80%) were treated successfully and 10 (16.7%) had recurrence of inflammation. Conclusions: We recommend that in patients presenting with lacrimal gland inflammation (i.e., erythema, edema, tenderness) in which the specific diagnosis cannot be made clinically and on imaging, biopsy is warranted for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We found that the majority of these patients (61.7%) had specific histopathology, and 38% had systemic diseases. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",Autoimmune diseases; lacrimal gland biopsy; lacrimal gland inflammation,antibiotic agent; antineoplastic agent; azathioprine; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin; flurbiprofen; hydroxychloroquine; methotrexate; prednisolone; prednisone; steroid; adult; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; child; Churg Strauss syndrome; clinical feature; dacryocystitis; eye biopsy; eye inflammation; female; fibrosis; histopathology; human; human tissue; lacrimal gland disease; lymphocytic infiltration; lymphocytic lymphoma; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; medical record review; myoepithelial carcinoma; ocular fibrosis; retrospective study; school child; Sjoegren syndrome; steroid therapy; systemic disease; treatment outcome; Wegener granulomatosis; xanthogranuloma,Article

Here, the authors report a study on twelve fragile X males with atypical mosaicism, seven of whom presented with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: A combination of Southern Blot and PCR analysis was used for CGG allele sizing and methylation. FMR1 mRNA and FMRP expression were measured by qRT-PCR and by Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence methodology, respectively. Results: DNA analysis showed atypical size- or methylation-mosaicism with both, full mutation and smaller (normal to premutation) alleles, as well as a combination of methylated and unmethylated alleles. Four individuals carried a deletion of the CGG repeat and portions of the flanking regions. The extent of methylation among the participants was reflected in the lower FMR1 mRNA and FMRP expression levels detected in these subjects. Conclusion: Decreased gene expression is likely the main contributor to the cognitive impairment observed in these subjects; although the presence of a normal allele did not appear to compensate for the presence of the full mutation, it correlated with better cognitive function in some but not all of the reported cases emphasizing the complexity of the molecular and clinical profile in FXS. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",deletion; FMR1mRNA; FMRP; fragile X syndrome; methylation; mosaicism; transcription,amphetamine plus dexamphetamine; aripiprazole; clonidine; DNA; fish oil; folic acid; fragile X mental retardation protein; lorazepam; messenger RNA; methylphenidate; minocycline; quetiapine; risperidone; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; sertraline; adolescent; adult; aggression; amplicon; anger; Article; attention deficit disorder; autism; birth weight; case report; child; clinical article; disease severity; DNA determination; DNA flanking region; fluorescence; follow up; fragile X syndrome; gene expression; gene mutation; head circumference; human; intelligence quotient; kyphosis; macroorchidism; male; methylation; mosaicism; nocturnal enuresis; physical examination; polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; school child; separation anxiety; Southern blotting; tendon reflex; young adult,Article

Mechanistically, β-catenin regulates expression of downstream targets of a key transcriptional memory gene, Hoxa9 that is highly enriched in LSK-derived MLL-CSCs and helps sustain leukemic self-renewal. Suppression of Hoxa9 sensitizes LSK-derived MLL-CSCs to β-catenin inhibition resulting in abolishment of CSC transcriptional program and transformation ability. In addition, further molecular and functional analyses identified Prmt1 as a key common downstream mediator for β-catenin/Hoxa9 functions in LSK-derived MLL-CSCs. Together, these findings not only uncover an unexpectedly important role of cells of origin transcriptional memory in regulating CSC self-renewal, but also reveal a novel molecular network mediated by β-catenin/Hoxa9/Prmt1 in governing leukemic self-renewal. © 2017 The Authors",cells of origin; Hoxa9; MLL leukemia; Prmt1; Wnt/β-catenin,"ataxin 1; beta catenin; guanosine phosphate; mixed lineage leukemia protein; stem cell factor receptor; transcription factor HoxA9; beta catenin; CTNNB1 protein, human; homeodomain protein; Ly antigen; Ly6a protein, mouse; membrane protein; PRMT1 protein, human; protein arginine methyltransferase; repressor protein; small interfering RNA; stem cell factor receptor; transcription factor HoxA9; acute myeloid leukemia; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer stem cell; down regulation; gene expression regulation; gene repression; genetic transcription; genetic variation; hematopoietic stem cell; Hoxa9 gene; human; human cell; inhibition kinetics; mouse; multicenter study; nonhuman; priority journal; stem cell self-renewal; transcription regulation; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; C57BL mouse; cancer stem cell; cell proliferation; cell survival; disease model; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; knockout mouse; metabolism; mortality; pathology; signal transduction; survival analysis; Animals; Antigens, Ly; beta Catenin; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit; Repressor Proteins; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Survival Analysis; Transcription, Genetic",Article

The community benefits greatly from the availability of local foods, such as cereals, tubers, wild vegetables, mushrooms, fruits, and animals. In the first phase of this project, 387 distinct local foods were identified, which were shown to be good sources of energy, protein, and vitamins. Despite the availability of a variety of nutritious local foods, the majority of households surveyed expressed concern over a decline in local foods due to changing socio-economic and environmental conditions. This study used a qualitative research approach to look at the dual influences of matriarchy and Buddhism on food security in the community. Through this approach, matriarchal values central to the community were adopted as a framework; these included care, consensus, collaboration, and cosmological respect. In Sanephong, women are central to life in the community, and matriarchal cultural practices reflect a nurturing spirit—for both the earth and family. The community practices Buddhism, which is very complementary to the matriarchal system. A type of gift economy within the Buddhist context, known as dhana, transfers food from the wealthy to the poor with no expectation of reciprocity. Consequently, matriarchy and Buddhism jointly promote food security in the community. Studies of matriarchal societies help society-at-large to understand the potential benefits of systems that contrast the current patriarchal paradigm. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Buddhism; food security; Indigenous Peoples; Karen; local food; matriarchy,adult; Article; Buddhism; community; conceptual framework; consensus; cosmological phenomena; economic aspect; female; food security; health care; human; intersectoral collaboration; male; matriarchy; middle aged; priority journal; qualitative research; social structure; Thailand,Article

Using both in vitro and in vivo models, LXR regulation of the expression and function of renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) was observed. Synthetic LXR agonist (GW3965) and endogenous LXR agonist (22R-hydroxycholesterol) significantly reduced the uptake of 3H–MPP+, a prototypic substrate of OCT2, in both OCT2- Chinese hamster ovary K1 and human renal proximal tubular cells (RPTEC/TERT1). GW3965 decreased transport activity of OCT2 via a reduction of the maximal transport rate of MPP+ without affecting transporter affinity. The inhibitory effect of GW3965 was attenuated by co-treatment with LXR antagonist (fenofibrate) indicating the inhibition was LXR-dependent mechanism. In addition, co-treatment with a retinoic X receptor (RXR) ligand, 9-cis retinoic acid enhanced the inhibitory effect of GW3965, indicating negative regulation of OCT2 transport activity by the LXR/RXR complex. Treatment RPTEC/TERT1 cells with GW3965 significantly reduced OCT2 protein expression without changing mRNA expression. In parallel, the effect of LXR activation on OCT2 function was investigated in intact mouse kidney. Treating mice with 50 mg/kg BW T0901317 for 14 days significantly decreased 3H–MPP+ uptake into renal cortical slices, correlating with decreased OCT2 protein expression in renal cortex without changes in mRNA expression levels. Taken together, LXR/RXR activation downregulates the protein expression and function of OCT2 in renal proximal tubule, suggesting LXR might affect the total profile of renal excretion of cationic compounds. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Kidney; Nuclear receptors; Proximal tubule; Regulation; Retinoic x receptor; Secretion,"22 hydroxycholesterol; 3 [3 [[2 chloro 3 (trifluoromethyl)benzyl](2 diphenylethyl)amino]propoxy]phenylacetic acid; alitretinoin; cholesterol; fenofibrate; liver X receptor; n (2,2,2 trifluoroethyl) n [4 (2,2,2 trifluoro 1 hydroxy 1 trifluoromethylethyl)phenyl]benzenesulfonamide; organic cation transporter 2; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cell viability; cholesterol level; controlled study; female; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; kidney cortex slice; kidney proximal tubule; kidney tubule cell; male; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein interaction; protein transport",Article

Methods: Participants (n = 439), aged ≥65 years with mild-to-moderate balance dysfunction were randomly assigned to an exercise (n = 219) or control (n = 220) group. The program consisted of five combined exercises, which progressed in difficulty, and a walking plan. Controls received fall prevention education. Physical functioning and other outcomes were measured at 3- and 6-month follow-up visits. Falls were monitored with fall diaries and phone interviews at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months respectively. Results: The 12 months of the home-based exercise program showed the incidence of falls was 0.30 falls per person year in the exercise group, compared with 0.40 in the control group. The estimated incidence rate ratio was 0.75 (95% CI 0.55–1.04), which was not statistically significant. The fear of falling (measured by the Thai fall efficacy scale) was significantly lower in the exercise than control group (24.7 vs 27.0, P = 0.003). Also, the trend of program adherence increased in the exercise group. (29.6% to 56.8%). Conclusions: This simple home-based exercise program showed a reduction in fear of falling and a positive trend towards exercise adherence. Further studies should focus on factors associated with exercise adherence, the benefits of increased home visits and should follow participants longer in order to evaluate the effects of the program.

Characteristic fundoscopy reveals numerous whitish-yellow spots located in the retinal pigment epithelium that extend from the posterior pole to the periphery. Electroretinographic (ERG) recordings are very distinctive in patients with FA. The amplitude of scotopic (rod) ERG is significantly reduced when recorded after conventional dark adaptation, but it becomes larger and comes to normal range after prolonged dark adaptation (more than two hours). FA has been attributed to mutation in the RDH5 gene, which encodes 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase, an enzyme that is essential for the regeneration of visual pigments in the retina. To date, at least 100 patients with FA and 44 mutations in the RDH5 gene have been reported worldwide. FA is a rare disease that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

The study assessed perceptions of governance of marine and coastal resources among national and provincial authorities and Koh Tao residents on the basis of governance components − law, institutions and process − and governance principles − transparency, participation, rule of law, accountability and access to justice. Governance to deal with the anticipated continued growth in marine-based tourism is challenged. The study identified misunderstandings about governance and governance weaknesses, which, if they are not addressed, will be obstacles to the future sustainable development of Koh Tao. The research findings indicate that supporting local governance will be key to maintaining sustainable use of marine and coastal resources on the island and ensuring the sustainability of the local economy, which depends on these resources.

In this study, we explored the involvement of FoxO3 in severe β-thalassemia. Using primary CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients with β-thalassemia major, we successfully developed an in vitro model of ineffective erythropoiesis. Based on this model, FoxO3 activity was quantified in single cells using high throughput imaging flow cytometry. This study revealed a significant reduction of FoxO3 activity during the late stage of erythroblast differentiation in β-thalassemia, in contrast to erythropoiesis in normal cells that maintain persistent activation of FoxO3. In agreement with the decreased FoxO3 activity in β-thalassemia, the expression of FoxO3 target genes was also found to decrease, concurrent with elevated phosphorylation of AKT, most clearly at the late stage of erythroid differentiation. Our findings provide further evidence for the involvement of FoxO3 during terminal erythropoiesis and confirm the modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway as a potential therapeutic strategy for β-thalassemia. © 2017 Thanuthanakhun et al.

The role of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent RARS in children with nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) has not been investigated. Objective To evaluate the effect of azithromycin to prevent RARS in children with NAR. Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in NAR children (5-15 years) with RARS. Azithromycin (5 mg/kg/d) 3 d/wk for 12 months or placebo was assigned to the study group and the control group, respectively. Patients with allergic rhinitis were excluded. Number of rhinosinusitis episodes in 12 months, visual analog scale score of nasal symptoms, and adjunctive medication score were recorded. Results Forty patients were enrolled and 20 patients were assigned randomly to the azithromycin and placebo groups. IgG subclass and specific antibody deficiencies were found in 83% and 2.5% of patients, respectively. After 12 months, the number of rhinosinusitis episodes/y in the azithromycin group reduced significantly from 5 to 0.5 (P <.001) in contrast to the placebo group. Number needed to treat using azithromycin prophylaxis to prevent 1 patient from having RARS was 2. The average visual analog scale score and the average adjunctive medication score in the azithromycin (but not in the placebo) group reduced significantly compared with baseline (2.2 ± 1.4 vs 5.4 ± 1.8) and (3.9 ± 1.7 vs 5.4 ± 1.1), respectively (P <.001).

We aimed to establish the proper sampling depth of centrifuged specimens for LE testing as one diagnostic criterion and also AS-D chloroacetate esterase (CAE) staining testing as an adjunctive tool. A definite PJI knee joint group and an aseptic primary total knee arthroplasty control group were studied quasi-experimentally (N = 46). At 2,000 g for 15 min, 3 ml of synovial fluid was centrifuged. LE strip testing and median synovial WBC count were performed at 2, 4, and 6 mm depths. CAE staining test characterized LE particles. ROC curve, area under the curve, and significant differences were determined. The proper predictive depth to diagnose PJI was sought by forward stepwise logistic regression. All fresh blood-tinged specimens had uncertain interpretations. Centrifugation increased interpretability (55–100%). ROC curve and area under the curve at 2, 4, and 6 mm depths were 0.822, 0.804, and 0.786, respectively. The cut point of ++ to diagnose PJI was statistically significant (p < 0.05) at all depths. p-values of forward stepwise logistic regression at 2, 4, and 6 mm were 0.001, 0.752, and 0.756, respectively. CAE staining confirmed extracellular LE release by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). A specimen at <2 mm from the surface of centrifuged synovial fluid at a grading of ++ or more for PJI diagnosis is proper for LE testing.

It is responsible for various clinical manifestations, including favism, hemolytic anemia, chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, spontaneous abortion, and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the severity of G6PD deficiency is of great importance but that of many G6PD variants are still unknown. In this study, we report the construction, expression, purification, and biochemical characterization in terms of kinetic properties and stability of five clinical G6PD variants—G6PD Bangkok, G6PD Bangkok noi, G6PD Songklanagarind, G6PD Canton + Bangkok noi, and G6PD Union + Viangchan. G6PD Bangkok and G6PD Canton + Bangkok noi showed a complete loss of catalytic activity and moderate reduction in thermal stability when compared with the native G6PD. G6PD Bangkok noi and G6PD Union + Viangchan showed a significant reduction in catalytic efficiency, whereas G6PD Songklanagarind showed a catalytic activity comparable to the wild-type enzyme. The Union + Viangchan mutation showed a remarkable effect on the global stability of the enzyme. In addition, our results indicate that the location of mutations in G6PD variants affects their catalytic activity, stability, and structure. Hence, our results provide a molecular explanation for clinical manifestations observed in individuals with G6PD deficiency. © 2017 The Authors",Catalytic activity; G6PD deficiency; Thermal stability,"glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; amino acid substitution; Article; binding affinity; binding site; catalytic efficiency; circular dichroism; clinical feature; conformational transition; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme purification; enzyme stability; enzyme substrate; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; mutant; protein conformation; protein expression; protein secondary structure; site directed mutagenesis; steady state; Thailand; thermostability; wild type; biocatalysis; chemistry; enzyme stability; enzymology; genetics; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; kinetics; metabolism; molecular model; mutation; protein multimerization; protein quaternary structure; Biocatalysis; Enzyme Stability; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Mutation; Protein Multimerization; Protein Structure, Quaternary",Article

In crustaceans, molt is regulated by ecdysteroids or molting hormones that are synthesized in Y-organs. However, ecdysteroid biosynthesis pathway in crustaceans and its participating enzymes have not been well studied so far. In this study, a Rieske domain oxygenase, the enzyme that acts as cholesterol 7,8-dehydrogenase by converting cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol in the first step of the ecdysteroid biosynthesis was characterized in black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. A full-length cDNA of P. monodon's Rieske domain oxygenase Neverland (PmNvd) was successfully cloned. The expression of PmNvd was dominantly found in the Y-organ, and changed during molting period. The PmNvd mRNA level was low in intermolt and early premolt stages, then dramatically increased in the mid premolt stage suggesting its role in molt regulation. The function of PmNvd in the molting process was investigated by RNAi approach. Silencing of PmNvd transcript in shrimp by specific double-stranded RNA (dsNvd) led to prolonged molt duration with abnormal molting progression, i.e. the molting process got stuck at early premolt stage. In addition, 20-hydroxyecdysone titer in the hemolymph of dsNvd-injected shrimp was significantly reduced compared with that in NaCl-injected shrimp. These evidences suggested a crucial role of PmNvd in molt progression, particularly during the initiation of premolt phase via the regulation of ecdysteroid production. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cholesterol 7,8-dehydrogenase; Cholesterol 7-desaturase; Ecdysteroid biosynthesis; Molt; Rieske domain oxygenase; Shrimp","7 dehydrocholesterol; cholesterol; cholesterol 7,8 dehydrogenase; complementary DNA; double stranded RNA; ecdysteroid; ecdysterone; messenger RNA; oxidoreductase; oxygenase; Rieske domain oxygenase; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; oxygenase; adult; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; Article; developmental stage; female; gene expression profiling; hemolymph; hormone synthesis; molecular cloning; molting; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Penaeus monodon; regulatory mechanism; RNA interference; animal; gene silencing; genetics; metabolism; Penaeidae; phylogeny; physiology; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sequence homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; Gene Silencing; Hemolymph; Molting; Oxygenases; Penaeidae; Phylogeny; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid",Article

However, its sizes appeared to be relatively large for most of our patients. Thus, we have developed a specific applicator “Siriraj Ring Cap,” which is slightly smaller and more suitable for our patients. This study was to evaluate effectiveness of this equipment. Methods and Materials Locally advanced cervical cancer patients were treated with external beam radiation therapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy. Siriraj Ring Cap was applied in all of the patients for at least one fraction. Dosimetric analysis was performed in each fraction of IGBT. Clinical outcomes of these patients were evaluated. Results Twenty-nine patients with 117 dosimetric planning were evaluated between January and December of 2014. Siriraj Ring Cap was fit to all patients in this study. By using this applicator, radiation doses to the targets (D90 high-risk clinical target volume and D90 intermediate-risk clinical target volume) were higher in each fraction. There were no statistically differences of radiation doses to the bladder, rectum, sigmoid colon, and small bowel. Within 2-year followup, 3 patients (10.3%) developed locoregional recurrence. Two-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 75.9% and 89.7%, respectively. According to RTOG/EORTC complication criteria, Grade 1, 2, and 3 gastrointestinal complications were developed in 2 (6.9%), 4 (13.8%), and 1 (3.4%) patients, respectively. For genitourinary complications, 3 patients (10.3%) and 1 patient (3.4%) had Grades 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusions Siriraj Ring Cap is feasible for IGBT in cervical cancer patients with narrow vagina.

The release of ITZ from all micelles was biphasic and sustained in simulated saliva fluid over 48 h. The 3:7 and 0:10 TPGS/TPGS-Cys micelles had a good mucoadhesive property. Meanwhile, only 0:10 TPGS/TPGS-Cys micelles enhanced the permeability through buccal mucosa and potentiated the antifungal activity of ITZ against Candida albicans by at least 1.35 folds as compared to ITZ alone. Therefore, this formulation can be further developed for the transmucosal delivery of ITZ for the treatment of C. albicans. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Candida albicans; D-ɑ-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate; Itraconazole; Micelles; Mucoadhesive; Thiolated polymer; Transmucosal delivery,itraconazole; polymer; thiol group; thiolated dextro alpha tocopheryl poly(ethylene glycol) 1000 succinate; unclassified drug; antifungal activity; antifungal therapy; Article; buccal mucosa; Candida albicans; candidiasis; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; critical micelle concentration; drug formulation; drug release; high performance liquid chromatography; in vitro study; infrared spectroscopy; minimum fungicidal concentration; minimum inhibitory concentration; mucosal drug administration; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; particle size; permeability; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantitative analysis; surface charge; synthesis; zeta potential,Article

Recently, HCV was classified into 6 major genotypes (GTs) and 67 subtypes (STs). Efficient genotyping has become an essential tool for prognosis and indicating suitable treatment, prior to starting therapy in all HCV-infected individuals. The widely used genotyping assays have limitation with regard to genotype accuracy. This study was a comparative evaluation of exact HCV genotyping in a newly developed automated-massively parallel sequencing (MPS) system, versus the established Line probe assay 2.0 (LiPA), substantiated by Sanger sequencing, using 120 previously identified-HCV RNA positive specimens. LiPA gave identical genotypes in the majority of samples tested with MPS. However, as much as 25% of LiPA did not identify subtypes, whereas MPS did, and 0.83% of results were incompatible. Interestingly, only MPS could identify mixed infections in the remaining cases (1.67%). In addition, MPS could detect Resistance-Associated Variants (RAVs) simultaneously in GT1 in 56.82% of the specimens, which were known to affect drug resistance in the HCV NS3/NS4A and NS5A genomic regions. MPS can thus be deemed beneficial for guiding decisions on HCV therapy and saving costs in the long term when compared to traditional methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",HCV genotyping; Massively parallel sequencing; Mixed HCV infection; Sanger sequencing,antivirus agent; nonstructural protein 4A inhibitor; nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor; unclassified drug; antiviral resistance; Article; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; cost control; diagnostic kit; genotype; genotyping technique; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; human; line probe assay; major clinical study; mixed infection; next generation sequencing; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; prognosis; Sanger sequencing; virus detection,Article

Although such fractures usually heal without long-term sequelae, some are associated with lifelong disabilities, such as brachial plexus injuries. The purpose of this study was primarily to investigate risk factors related to birth fractures. Methods: This study comprised newborns delivered at our institute between 2003 and 2013. All 46 birth fractures were reviewed and compared with 223 randomly selected normal neonates. Demographic data of newborns and their mothers, as well as the details of delivery and fracture characteristics, were recorded. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to differentiate the risk factors. Results: Forty-six babies had birth fractures, and 223 babies were without fracture. Forty-five cases were midclavicular fractures and one was a humeral-shaft fracture. Babies with a fracture had significantly higher birthweight and length and were larger for gestational age (p ≤ 0.001 for all factors). After multivariate analysis, parameters that remained significantly correlated with higher fracture risk included nurse attendant [odds ratio (OR) 34.8, p = 0.004], large for gestational age (OR 12.1, p < 0.001), instrumented delivery (OR 10.62, p < 0.001), and meconium stain (OR 3.10, p = 0.004). A high Apgar score at one minute and cesarean delivery were associated with decreased fracture risk (OR 0.39, p = 0.004 and OR 0.12, p = 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Patient (including large for gestational age) and peripartum (including meconium stain, shoulder dystocia, instrumented delivery, and nurse attendant) factors were associated with a higher risk of birth fracture. Factors related to a decreased risk were a high Apgar score at one minute and cesarean delivery. Careful prenatal assessments are recommended to evaluate the risk of birth fracture and prompt cesarean section for patients at high risk. © 2017, SICOT aisbl.",Birth fracture; Clavicular fracture; Neonatal fracture; Obstetric clavicular fracture; Obstetric injury,Apgar score; Article; birth fracture; birth injury; case control study; cesarean section; clavicle fracture; clinical article; demography; female; fracture; gestational age; head circumference; human; humeral shaft; humerus shaft fracture; instrumental delivery; large for gestational age; male; meconium; newborn; obstetric delivery; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; shoulder dystocia,Article

However, the increasing prevalence of artemisinin resistance is threatening efforts to treat and eliminate malaria in Southeast Asia. This study aimed to characterize the exposure-response relationship of artesunate in patients with artemisinin sensitive and resistant malaria infections. Patients were recruited in Pailin, Cambodia (n = 39), and Wang Pha, Thailand (n = 40), and received either 2 mg/kg/day of artesunate mono-therapy for 7 consecutive days or 4 mg/kg/day of artesunate monotherapy for 3 consecutive days followed by mefloquine 15 and 10 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days. Plasma concentrations of artesunate and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin, and microscopy-based parasite densities were measured and evaluated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. All treatments were well tolerated with minor and transient adverse reactions. Patients in Cambodia had substantially slower parasite clearance compared to patients in Thailand. The pharmacokinetic properties of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin were well described by transit-compartment absorption followed by one-compartment disposition models. Parasite density was a significant covariate, and higher parasite densities were associated with increased absorption. Dihydroartemisinin-dependent parasite killing was described by a delayed sigmoidal Emax model, and a mixture function was implemented to differentiate between sensitive and resistant infections. This predicted that 84% and 16% of infections in Cambodia and Thailand, respectively, were artemisinin resistant. The final model was used to develop a simple diagnostic nomogram to identify patients with artemisinin-resistant infections. The nomogram showed > 80% specificity and sensitivity, and outperformed the current practice of day 3 positivity testing. © 2017, The Author(s).",malaria; parasite clearance; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics; resistance,artemisinin; artesunate; dihydroartemisinin; mefloquine; adult; antimalarial drug resistance; Article; Cambodia; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug blood level; drug effect; drug exposure; drug tolerability; EC50; female; human; in vivo study; major clinical study; malaria falciparum; male; maximum drug effect; mean transit time; parasite clearance; Thailand; treatment response; volume of distribution,Article

Antioxidants have been shown to be instrumental in counteracting the deleterious effects of these reactive oxygen species. Herein, a series of 20 pyrazolopyridine derivatives with antioxidant activity were utilized for constructing a quantitative structure–activity relationship model as to unravel the origins of the antioxidant activity. Quantum chemical and molecular descriptors were used to quantitate the physicochemical properties of investigated compounds. Significant descriptors as identified by stepwise regression analysis consisted of Mor11m, Mor25v, JGI5, H8p, GATS5p, and GVWAI-50. Statistical parameters suggested that the constructed quantitative structure–activity relationship models were robust with Q2 = 0.9370 and root mean square error = 4.7414 as evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation. The mechanistic basis of the antioxidant activity as deduced from significant descriptors was rationalized. Particularly, compounds with the highest antioxidant activity required compounds to have the highest mean topological charge index of order 5 (JGI5) and Geary autocorrelation–lag 5/weighted by atomic polarizabilities (GATS5p) but necessitated low 3D-MoRSE-signal 25/weighted by atomic van der Waals volumes (Mor25v). Such properties are well corroborated by the 3-aminopyrazole pharmacophore from investigated compounds. Molecular insights unraveled herein is anticipated to be useful as guidelines for further rational design of novel pyrazole analogs with potent antioxidant activity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Antioxidant activity; Data mining; Multiple linear regression; Oxidative stress; Pyrazolopyridine; QSAR,3 aminopyrazole; antioxidant; pyrazole derivative; pyridine; quinone derivative; unclassified drug; antioxidant activity; Article; chemical structure; pharmacophore; physical chemistry; quantitative structure activity relation; quantum chemistry,Article

To use flow cytometry studying the interactions between DENV and human platelet aggregation receptor, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (gpIIb/IIIa), directly conjugated fluorochrome monoclonal antibody (mAb) is essential to facilitate multifluorochrome immunostaining. However, the obstacle was that no directly conjugated fluorochrome-anti-DENV mAb had been commercially available. To overcome, we directly conjugated fluorochrome to a primary anti-DENV mAb using a LYNX rapid conjugation kit. Flow cytometry analysis showed that this conjugated antibody and anti-gpIIb/IIIa mAb were able to detect DENV and CD41a simultaneously. Fluorescence microscopy analysis further demonstrated CD41a superficially and DENV intracellularly. Potentially, this strategy can facilitate virologists for directly conjugating any virus-specific primary antibodies, which are not commercially available with fluorochrome, to study the infectivity in any surface marker-specific hosts through flow cytometry. Together, DENV can interact with both human gpIIb/IIIa- and gpIIb/IIIa+ cells revealed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy for the first time. © 2017 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",dengue virus; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; glycoprotein IIb/IIIa,antibody conjugate; CD41a antigen; fibrinogen receptor; fluorescein isothiocyanate; fluorochrome; lymphocyte antigen; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody D3 2H2 9 21; phycoerythrin; unclassified drug; animal cell; antibody specificity; antigen binding; antigen specificity; Article; conjugation; controlled study; dengue; Dengue virus; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; fluorochrome staining; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; MEG-01 cell line; megakaryocyte; nonhuman; Vero cell line; virus cell interaction; virus detection; virus infectivity,Article

Thus, we hypothesized that previously reported microarray results for the presence of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) open reading frames (ORFs) formerly called 151, 366 and 427 in a domesticated giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) breeding stock might have represented expression from EVE, since the stock had shown uninterrupted freedom from white spot disease (WSD) for many generations. To test this hypothesis, 128 specimens from a current stock generation were confirmed for freedom from WSSV infection using two nested PCR detection methods. Subsequent nested-PCR testing revealed 33/128 specimens (26%) positive for at least one of the ORF at very high sequence identity (95–99%) to extant WSSV. Positive results for ORF 366 (now known to be a fragment of the WSSV capsid protein gene) dominated (28/33 = 84.8%), so 9 arbitrarily selected 366-positive specimens were tested by strand-specific, nested RT-PCR using DNase-treated RNA templates. This revealed variable RNA expression in individual shrimp including no RNA transcripts (n = 1), sense transcripts only (n = 1), antisense transcripts only (n = 2) or transcripts of both sense (n = 5). The latter 7 expression products indicated specimens producing putative imRNA. The variable types and numbers of the EVE and the variable RNA expression (including potential imRNA) support predictions of the viral accommodation hypothesis that EVE are randomly produced and expressed. Positive nested PCR test results for EVE of ORF 366 using DNA templates derived from shrimp sperm (germ cells), indicated that they were heritable. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Endogenous viral elements (EVE); Penaeus monodon; Variable EVE; Viariable RNA transcripts; White spot syndrome virus; WSSV,"mitochondrial DNA; RNA precursor; transcriptome; virus DNA; amplicon; Article; breeding; DNA template; gene expression; gene frequency; gene sequence; germ cell; heterozygosity; homozygosity; Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus; nonhuman; open reading frame; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; shrimp; virus genome; virus mutation; White spot syndrome virus; animal; Artemia; genetics; immunological tolerance; molecular evolution; physiology; virology; virus DNA cell DNA interaction; White spot syndrome virus; Animals; Artemia; DNA, Viral; Evolution, Molecular; Germ Cells; Immune Tolerance; Open Reading Frames; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Precursors; Transcriptome; Virus Integration; White spot syndrome virus 1",Article

The mainstay of treatment is surgery with or without radiation therapy (RT). The objective of this study was to investigate progression-free survival (PFS) and factors associated with postoperative recurrence in patients with atypical meningioma. Methods Patients with diagnoses of atypical menigioma who underwent surgery at Siriraj Hospital during the 2004 to 2014 study period were included. Features potentially associated with PFS and tumor recurrence from clinical records, operative records, and neuroimaging studies were evaluated and analyzed. Results One hundred twenty-six patients (mean age, 55 years) were included. The median PFS was 55 months. The 5-year and 10-year PFS rates were 72.5% and 32%, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 52 months. In multivariate analysis, tumor location (convexity, parasagittal/falcine, intraventricular, skull base) (P = 0.003), and pial invasion (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.02; P = 0.045) were significantly associated with tumor recurrence. Postoperative RT was associated with reduction in tumor recurrence in both univariate (odds ratio: 0.48; P = 0.039) and multivariate analysis (HR: 0.42; P = 0.005). Conclusions Tumor location and pial invasion were significantly correlated with increased incidence of tumor recurrence, and postoperative RT was found to be significantly associated with decreased tumor progression and recurrence. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Atypical meningioma; Progression-free survival; Recurrence; Treatment,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; brain ventricle tumor; cancer incidence; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer survival; clinical evaluation; edema; female; follow up; gender; headache; human; hyperostosis; Karnofsky Performance Status; major clinical study; male; median survival time; medical record review; meningioma; motor dysfunction; neuroimaging; oncological parameters; paresthesia; pia mater; postoperative period; progression free survival; retrospective study; sensory dysfunction; skull base tumor; surgical margin; survival analysis; survival factor; survival rate; tumor growth; tumor invasion; tumor location; tumor recurrence; tumor volume; visual impairment; weakness; adjuvant radiotherapy; disease free survival; Kaplan Meier method; meningioma; middle aged; mortality; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; sex ratio; tumor recurrence; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Meningeal Neoplasms; Meningioma; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Retrospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Skull Base Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult",Article

The main focus of this study was to assess practices regarding security and confidentiality of HIV-related information among staff at HIV outpatient clinics (HIV-OPCs) in Vietnam. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at all 312 HIV-OPCs across the country using an online survey technique. Results: In general, the staff practices for securing and protecting patient information were at acceptable levels. Most staff had proper measures and practices for maintaining data security; however, the protection of patient confidentiality, particularly for data access, sharing, and transfer still required improvement. Most HIV-OPC staff had good or moderate knowledge and positive perceptions towards security and confidentiality issues. Staff who were not trained in the practice of security measures differed significantly from those who were trained (OR: 3.74; 95%CI: 1.44–9.67); staff needing improved knowledge levels differed significantly from those with good (OR: 5.20; 95%CI: 2.39–11.32) and moderate knowledge levels (OR: 5.10; 95%CI: 2.36–11.00); and staff needing improved perception levels differed significantly from those with good (i.e., with 100% proper practices) and moderate perception levels (OR: 5.67; 95%CI: 2.93–10.95). Staff who were not trained in the protection of data confidentiality differed significantly from those who were trained (OR: 2.18; 95%CI: 1.29–3.65). Conclusions Training is an important factor to help raise the levels of proper practices regarding confidentiality and security, to improve knowledge and raise awareness about change among staff. The operation and management of HIV treatment and care in Vietnam are currently transitioning from separate healthcare clinics (HIV-OPC) into units integrated into general hospitals/healthcare facilities. The findings of this study highlight topics that could be used for improving management and operation of information system and revising guidelines and regulations on protection measures/strategies for data security and confidentiality of HIV/ AIDS patients by Vietnam health authorities or other countries facing similar situations. Secure infrastructure and secure measures for data access and use are very important, worthwhile investments. The provision of continuous training and active enforcement and monitoring of the practices of healthcare personnel might lead to an improved understanding and acknowledegement of the importance of national policies/guidelines regarding HIV-related patient information. © 2017 Khac Hai et al.

In academic research, eating alone is often simply treated as an alternative to social, commensal eating, and little is known about the practice of eating alone itself. This study employs a cross-cultural analysis to explore social and cultural associations of eating alone. The analysis is based on 1) cultural domain data, derived from principal component analysis of freelist responses, a set of words or phrases related to the topic of eating alone; and 2) in-depth interviews with 72 young adults aged 20–40 in urban Australia and Japan. Many Australian and Japanese young adult participants associated eating alone with both pleasure and stress of being isolated from others. However, the comparison of principal components between Australian and Japanese groups and gender subgroups showed cross-cultural variations and complexity in the context of eating alone including: locations and timings of eating alone, and associations with healthy/unhealthy eating. Analyses of interviews are included to deepen understandings of cultural domains. These key associations are influenced by a range of social and cultural environments such as fast food cultures, work and life environments, and the scope of public health nutrition programs. The association between eating alone and healthy eating among young adults indicates that individualistic understandings of food intake in current public health nutrition programs are more favorable to eating alone and foster a gap between ideas of healthy eating and commensal eating as a cultural ideal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cross-cultural study; Cultural domains; Eating alone; Freelisting,adult; Australia; commensal; controlled study; eating; fast food; female; gender; human; interview; Japan; Japanese (citizen); major clinical study; male; nonhuman; pleasure; principal component analysis; public health; stress; young adult,Article

To provide the maximum tendon length, the second incision needs to be as proximal as possible but injury to the muscle origin must be avoided. The purpose of this study is to establish the location of the second incision that yields the greatest tendon length. Forty-five unpaired embalmed cadaveric legs were dissected. Demographic data, gender, age, and side of specimen were recorded. The distance between the tip of the medial malleolus and the muscle origin was measured. Mobile tendon length, muscle origin, foot length, tibial length, and position of ankle were also noted. The mean mobile tendon length was 11.1 (range 10.7–11.4) cm and the distance between the tip of the medial malleolus and the muscle origin was 6.8 (range 6.5–7.0) cm. The mean foot length was 22.2 cm (range 21.7–22.7), tibial length was 31.5 cm (range 30.8–32.2), and muscle origin was 23.7 cm (range 21.0–26.3). The mean angle position was 46 degrees plantar flexion (range 43–49). In subgroup analysis by gender, the mobile tendon length, distance between the tip of the medial malleolus and the muscle origin, and tibial length, were significantly greater in males than females. In conclusion, for anterior transfer of the tibialis posterior tendon, an incision 7.1 cm above the medial malleolus in the male and 6.4 cm above it in the female provides the longest mobile tendon without injury to its origin.

We have previously reported that the serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine, as well as voluntary wheel running are effective in the treatment of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in stressed rats. But whether they are able to prevent deleterious consequences of restraint stress in rats, such as anxiety/depression-like behaviors and memory impairment that occur afterward, was not known. Herein, male Wistar rats were pre-treated for 4 weeks with anti-anxiety/anti-depressive drugs, agomelatine and venlafaxine, or voluntary wheel running, followed by 4 weeks of restraint-induced stress. During the stress period, rats received neither drug nor exercise intervention. Our results showed that restraint stress induced mixed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and memory impairment as determined by elevated plus-maze, elevated T-maze, open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and Morris water maze (MWM). Both pharmacological pre-treatments and running successfully prevented the anxiety-like behavior, especially learned fear, in stressed rats. MWM test suggested that agomelatine, venlafaxine, and running could prevent stress-induced memory impairment, but only pharmacological treatments led to better novel object recognition behavior and positive outcome in FST. Moreover, western blot analysis demonstrated that venlafaxine and running exercise upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. In conclusion, agomelatine, venlafaxine as well as voluntary wheel running had beneficial effects, i.e., preventing the restraint stress-induced anxiety/depression-like behaviors and memory impairment. © 2017 Lapmanee et al.

Long-standing SSc patients with the low disease activity suffer from incapacity as a consequence of tissue damage. The factors correlating with disability in long-standing SSc patients have not been emphasized. Objective: To analyze the body composition, physical function, and nutritional status in SSc patients and determine the parameters correlated with disability. Material and Method: Sixty of SSc patients characterized into three subgroups as: 1) diffuse SSc (dSSc; n = 46), 2) limited SSc (lSSc, n = 6), and 3) SSc with overlap syndrome (SSc-overlap, n = 8) were enrolled. Clinical data, body composition, physical function, and disability were evaluated. Results: There were no difference in clinical characteristics, functional assessment, body composition, and disability among three subgroups of SSc patients. The data analysis demonstrated the parameters strongly correlated with disability were factors related to: 1) disease activity (ESR; R = 0.413, p = 0.001 and the dose of prednisolone; R = 0.314, p = 0.014), 2) physical function (6-meter walk test; R = 0.402, p = 0.001, and peak expiratory flow rate; R = -0.27, p = 0.37), 3) body composition (skeletal mass; R = -0.257, p = 0.047), and 4) nutritional status (phase angle; R = -0.274, p = 0.043 and serum albumin; R = -0.424, p = 0.001).

Solid phase extraction (SPE) method was applied for the first time for simultaneous analysis of these indole metabolites. The MEKC separation method was developed in a previous work. Three commercial SPE cartridges, each with different sorbent materials, were investigated: Sep-Pak® C18, Oasis® HLB and Oasis® WCX. The Sep-Pak® C18 material provided the highest extraction recovery of 88–113% (n = 9), for the four target indole metabolites (I3C, DIM, I3CAL and I3A). The optimal washing and elution solutions were 40% methanol/water (v/v) and 100% methanol, respectively, and optimal elution volume was 2.0 mL. The specificity of the proposed SPE method was evaluated with negative control urine samples (n = 10) from healthy volunteers who had not taken the dietary supplement or vegetables known to contain indole compounds. Linear calibration curves were in the range of 0.2–25 μg mL−1 (r2 &gt; 0.998) using diphenylamine (DPA) as the internal standard. Intra-day and inter-day precisions were 3.5–12.3%RSD and 2.7–14.1%RSD, respectively. Limits of detection and quantification were 0.05–0.10 μg mL−1 and 0.10–0.50 μg mL−1, respectively. The four target indole compounds were separated within only 5 min by MEKC-UV analysis. Urine from 5 subjects who had taken a dietary supplement containing I3C and DIM were found to contain only the DIM metabolite at concentrations ranging from 0.10 to 0.35 µg mL−1. Accuracy of the proposed method based on the percentage recovery of spiked urine samples were 70–108%, 82–116%, 82–132% and 80–100% for I3C, I3CAL, I3A and DIM, respectively. The Sep-Pak®C18 cartridge was highly effective in extraction and sample cleanup for the downstream simultaneous detection of urinary indole metabolites by MEKC-UV method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Indole administration; Indole metabolites; MEKC-UV; Sep-Pak® C18; Solid phase extraction; Urine,Biomolecules; Body fluids; Dietary supplements; Food additives; Metabolites; Methanol; Nutrition; Phase separation; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Projectiles; Vitamins; Linear calibration curve; MEKC-UV; Sep-Pak; Simultaneous detection; Simultaneous determinations; Solid phase extraction method; Solid-phase extraction; Urine; Extraction,Article

Tafenoquine has a long half-life and the potential for more convenient dosing, compared with the currently recommended 14-day primaquine regimen. Methods: This randomized, active-control, double-blind trial was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax were randomized (2:1) to tafenoquine 400 mg once daily for 3 days or 2500 mg total dose chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg chloroquine base) given over 3 days plus primaquine 15 mg daily for 14 days. Patients were followed to day 120. Results: Day 28 adequate clinical response rate in the per-protocol population was 93% (40/43) (90%CI 83–98%) with tafenoquine, and 100% (22/22) (90%CI 87–100%) with chloroquine/ primaquine. Day 120 relapse prevention was 100% (35/35) with tafenoquine (90%CI 92–100%), and 95% (19/20) (90%CI 78–100%) with chloroquine/primaquine. Mean (SD) parasite, gametocyte and fever clearance times with tafenoquine were 82.5 h (32.3), 49.1 h (33.0), and 41.1 h (31.4) versus 40.0 h (15.7), 22.7 h (16.4), and 24.7 h (17.7) with chloroquine/primaquine, respectively. Peak methemoglobin was 1.4–25.6% (median 7.4%, mean 9.1%) in the tafenoquine arm, and 0.5–5.9% (median 1.5%, mean 1.9%) in the chloroquine/ primaquine arm. There were no clinical symptoms of methemoglobinemia in any patient. Discussion: Although there was no difference in efficacy in this study, the slow rate of parasite, gametocyte and fever clearance indicates that tafenoquine should not be used as monotherapy for radical cure of P. vivax malaria. Also, monotherapy increases the potential risk of resistance developing to this long-acting agent. Clinical trials of single-dose tafenoquine 300 mg combined with standard 3-day chloroquine or artemisinin-based combination therapy are ongoing.

From inception until February 2017, a systematic literature search identified twenty original reports of cases of mefenamic acid-induced enteropathy. Additional five cases were identified at our hospital. All cases were included in the analyses.PATIENT CONCERNS: Most patients had been regularly taking therapeutic dosages of mefenamic acid for at least three months before symptoms developed. All patients presented with chronic diarrhea with significant weight loss. Approximately one-third of the cases had some degree of anemia and hypoalbuminemia.DIAGNOSES: Endoscopic findings could range from very mild abnormalities, such as mild atrophic mucosa, to marked abnormalities, such as blunted villi with scalloping appearance in the small intestine and inflamed mucosa with a few superficial ulcers in the ileum and colon. Pathological findings included flattened small intestinal villi and mixed inflammatory infiltrates including eosinophils in lamina propria.INTERVENTION: After identifying history of prolong mefenamic acid exposure, all patients were prescribed to stop this medication. Nutritional support and substitutional treatment for mefenamic acid were provided as well.OUTCOMES: All symptoms responded dramatically to drug withdrawal. Some patients could change to use other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without symptoms reoccurring.LESSONS: Unlike other traditional NSAIDs, mefenamic acid could induce intestinal villous atrophy. An adequate drug history is crucial to identifying the condition. Protracted diarrhea occurring during treatment should be the indication to cease the medicine promptly.",,"mefenamic acid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; adverse drug reaction; aged; arthralgia; case report; chemically induced; diarrhea; enteropathy; female; human; middle aged; Migraine Disorders; time factor; Adult; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Arthralgia; Diarrhea; Female; Humans; Intestinal Diseases; Long Term Adverse Effects; Mefenamic Acid; Middle Aged; Migraine Disorders; Time Factors",Article

Hydroxyl, imine and azomethine groups in Schiff base derived compound 1 were deliberately introduced for facilitating the binding of Cu2+ ion. Of screen metal ions, compound 1 showed a high degree of selectivity toward Cu2+ ion. Other interfering metal ions did not affect the fluorescence intensity of compound 1, except Hg2+ and Fe3+ ions exhibited a significant degree of fluorescence quenching. Upon binding of Cu2+ ion, compound 1 displayed a chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) resulting in increasing of the fluorescence intensity. The molecular optimized geometry indicated the binding ratio between compound 1 and Cu2+ ion at 1:1 with the binding constant of 1.68 × 10− 7 M− 1. The optimized condition for sensing ability of compound 1 with a detection limit of 5 × 10− 7 M was found at the physiological pH 7.2 with the excitation wavelength of 366 nm. Due to no cytotoxicity and good photophysical properties, compound 1 was extended its application for the detection of Cu2+ ion in Vero cells. Compound 1 could be potentially used as an intracellular fluorescent chemosensor for tracking Cu2+ ion.

AIT of house dust mite allergy (HDM) using the mite crude extract (CE) as the therapeutic agent is not only less effective than the AIT for many other allergens, but also frequently causes adverse effects during the treatment course. In this study, mouse model of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) allergy was invented for testing therapeutic efficacies of intranasally administered liposome (L) encapsulated vaccines made of single Dp major allergens (L-Der p 1, L-Der p 2), combined allergens (L-Der p 1 and Der p 2), and crude Dp extract (L-CE). The allergen sparing intranasal route was chosen as it is known that the effective cells induced at the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue can exert their activities at the lower respiratory tissue due to the common mucosal traffic. Liposome was chosen as the vaccine delivery vehicle and adjuvant as the micelles could reduce toxicity of the entrapped cargo. The Dp-CE allergic mice received eight doses of individual vaccines/placebo on alternate days. All vaccine formulations caused reduction of the Th2 response of the Dp allergic mice. However, only the vaccines made of single refined allergens induced expressions of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-β, IL-35 and/or IL-10) which are the imperative signatures of successful AIT. The data emphasize the superior therapeutic efficacy of single refined major allergen vaccines than the crude allergenic extract vaccine. © 2017 Chaisri et al.

Surveys on the infective larvae of Gnathostoma spinigerum based on morphological features in freshwater swamp eels have been performed continuously and reported in Thailand. However, there is still limited molecular data on intra-species variations of the parasite. In this study, a total of 19 third-stage larvae of morphologically identified G. spinigerum were collected from 437 liver samples of freshwater swamp eels purchased from a large wholesale market in Bangkok, Thailand.

The freeze-dried and salt-leached sericin/poly(vinyl alcohol)/glycerin scaffolds with the same composition showed distinguished physical and in vitro biological characteristics. In this study, the in vivo safety and efficacy tests of both scaffolds as dressing materials for the healing of full-thickness wounds in rat model were performed in comparison with the clinically used dressing, Allevyn®. In the safety test, the scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously, and the signs of tissue irritation including the extent of inflammatory cells, calcification, vascularization, and fatty infiltration were scored. In the efficacy test, the scaffolds were applied to the full-thickness wound (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm), and the epithelialization and collagen formation in the wound were evaluated. Both freeze-dried and salt-leached scaffolds were characterized as non- to slightly irritant implantable materials. The freeze-dried scaffold minimally causes irritation to the tissue possibly because it was derived from the non-chemical relevant process. Furthermore, the freeze-dried scaffold showed the highest wound healing efficiency as characterized by the fastest epithelialization and highest extent of collagen formation. This might be due to the more sustained release of sericin from the freeze-dried scaffold, compared to that of the salt-leached scaffold. Therefore, fabrication process seemed to directly regulate the properties and applicability of the scaffolds. The safety and efficacy of the dressing materials in wound healing application depended not only on the materials themselves but also on the fabrication process that produces them. © SAGE Publications.",efficacy; Freeze-drying; in vivo; safety; salt-leaching; sericin; wound dressing,Accident prevention; Biomineralization; Collagen; Drying; Fabrication; Leaching; Low temperature drying; Safety testing; Tissue; efficacy; Freeze drying; In-vivo; Salt leaching; sericin; Wound dressings; Scaffolds (biology); collagen; glycerol; polyvinyl alcohol; sericin; sodium chloride; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; collagen synthesis; controlled study; device safety; epithelization; freeze drying; in vivo study; leaching; male; nonhuman; rat,Article

This organism, first reported in Martinique Island, now has become an emerging infectious agent in Thailand. Symptomatic cases of L. martiniquensis infection among humans have continuously increased. In the meantime, asymptomatic infection of this novel species has seriously created national public health awareness and concern to prevent and control disease transmission. The unsuccessful serological test using the commercial rK39 dipstick based on antigen from Leishmania donovani to detect the antibodies against VL among infected Thai patients has encouraged us to further explore a new sensitive and specific antigenic epitope. In this study, we determined the sequences and expressed recombinant proteins of kinesin 39 (k39), heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), heat shock protein 83 (hsp83), and glycoprotein 63 (gp63) of L. martiniquensis to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency to detect antibodies against L. martiniquensis in patient sera. The preliminary results from western blot analysis have suggested that K39 is the most sensitive recombinant protein to detect L. martiniquensis.

Because the brain cells demand high energy for maintaining their normal activities, disturbances in mitochondrial physiology may lead to neuropathological events underlying neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease. Melatonin is an endogenous compound with a variety of physiological roles. In addition, it possesses potent antioxidant properties which effectively play protective roles in several pathological conditions. Several lines of evidence also reveal roles of melatonin in mitochondrial protection, which could prevent development and progression of neurodegeneration. Since the mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary event in neurodegeneration, the neuroprotection afforded by melatonin is thereby more effective in early stages of the diseases.

Hepatic biopsy specimens obtained from fatal cases of DENV infection show apoptosis, which relates to the pathogenesis of DENV infection. However, how DENV induced liver injury is not fully understood. In this study, we aim to identify the factors that influence cell death by employing an apoptosis-related siRNA library screening. Our results show the effect of 558 gene silencing on caspase 3-mediated apoptosis in DENV-infected Huh7 cells. The majority of genes that contributed to apoptosis were the apoptosis-related kinase enzymes. Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 12 (TNFSF12), and sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2), were selected as the candidate genes to further validate their influences on DENV-induced apoptosis. Transfection of siRNA targeting SPHK2 but not TNFSF12 genes reduced apoptosis determined by Annexin V/PI staining. Knockdown of SPHK2 did not reduce caspase 8 activity; however, did significantly reduce caspase 9 activity, suggesting its involvement of SPHK2 in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Treatment of ABC294649, an inhibitor of SPHK2, reduced the caspase 3 activity, suggesting the involvement of its kinase activity in apoptosis. Knockdown of SPHK2 significantly reduced caspase 3 activity not only in DENV-infected Huh7 cells but also in DENV-infected HepG2 cells.

However, prevalence of OSA in GDM women, its relationship to metabolic control, and predictive factors have not been studied. Material and methods Eighty-two obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation participated. The Berlin questionnaire was used to assess OSA symptoms. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight monitor. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were obtained. Those with OSA underwent meal tolerance test (MTT) to assess their metabolic parameters. Classification tree analysis was used to develop a screening tool for OSA. Results At a median gestational age of 29 weeks, OSA was diagnosed in 52.4% of the women, with a median apnea hypopnea index of 9.4 (interquartile range 6.4, 12.4). More severe OSA was significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose but not HbA1c. For those with OSA, sleep parameters related to oxygen desaturation significantly correlated with higher fasting insulin resistance and more severe β-cell dysfunction, as evaluated by MTT. A screening tool involving two variables, neck circumference and Berlin Questionnaire score, was developed. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 51%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 70%. Conclusion OSA is prevalent in obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM in the late second to early third trimester. OSA severity, especially the degree of oxygen desaturation, correlated with fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and β-cell function. A simple screening tool involving the Berlin Questionnaire and neck circumference can aid in predicting OSA in this patient group. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Gestational diabetes; Insulin resistance; Prevalence; Screening tool; Sleep apnea,"glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; adult; apnea hypopnea index; Article; Berlin questionnaire; beta cell dysfunction; cell damage; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease association; disease severity; female; human; insulin resistance; major clinical study; maternal obesity; metabolic regulation; neck circumference; oxygen desaturation; prediction; predictive value; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; sensitivity and specificity; sleep disordered breathing; complication; devices; diet therapy; glucose blood level; metabolism; obesity; polysomnography; pregnancy; sleep disordered breathing; standards; third trimester pregnancy; Adult; Blood Glucose; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Obesity; Polysomnography; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Prevalence; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article

The taxonomic position of this strain was determined by a polyphasic approach. Strain S265T formed single globose spores on long, branching, aerial hyphae. It produced abundant aerial mycelium with green colour. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, and diagnostic whole-cell sugars were arabinose and galactose. Phosphatidylethanolamine and diphosphatidylglycerol were detected predominantly as polar lipids, whereas mycolic acids were not found. The major menaquinone was MK-9(H4), and principal cellular fatty acids were C15: 1 B, iso-C16: 1 H, anteiso-C15: 0 and C15: 0 2-OH. The DNA G+C content was 69 mol%. According to phylogenetic analysis, strain S265T was clustered with Saccharomonospora glauca K62T (98.1%) and Saccharomonospora viridis DSM 43017T (97.1%) despite its 16S rRNA gene sequence showing the highest similarity value to that of Saccharomonospora azurea NA-128T (98.6%). DNA–DNA relatedness values between strain S265T and the closely related strains were in the range of 7–50%, thus strengthening the evidence derived from the polyphasic study that strain S265T represents a novel species within the genus Saccharomonospora, for which the name Saccharomonospora colocasiae sp. nov. is proposed.

In vitro binding of either 1XrVP28 or 4XrVP28 to shrimp hemocyte surface was evident as early as 10 min after protein inoculation. Similar results were obtained in vivo when shrimp were injected with recombinant proteins that the proteins bound to the hemocyte surface could be detected since 5 min after injection. Comparison of the WSSV protection efficiencies of 1XrVP28 or 4XrVP28 were performed by injection the purified 1XrVP28 or 4XrVP28 (22.5 μg/shrimp) and WSSV inoculum (1000 copies/shrimp) into shrimp. At 10 dpi, while shrimp injected with WSSV inoculum reached 100% mortality, shrimp injected with 1XrVP28 + WSSV or 4XrVP28 + WSSV showed relative percent survival (RPS) of 67% and 81%, respectively. PCR quantification revealed high number of WSSV in the moribund shrimp of WSSV- and 1XrVP28+WSSV-injected group. In contrast, lower number of WSSV copies were found in the survivors both from 1XrVP28+WSSV- or 4XrVP28+WSSV- injected groups. Histopathological analysis demonstrated the WSSV infected lesions found in the moribund from WSSV-infected group and 1XrVP28+WSSV-injected group, but less or none in the survivors. ELISA demonstrated that 4XrVP28 exhibited higher affinity binding to rPmRab7, a WSSV binding protein essential for WSSV entry to the cell than 1XrVP28. Taken together, the protection against WSSV in shrimp could be improved by application of multimeric rVP28. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Monomeric recombinant VP28 (1XrVP28); Penaeus monodon; Tetrameric recombinant VP28 (4XrVP28); White spot syndrome virus (WSSV),"protein VP28; recombinant protein; unclassified drug; carrier protein; recombinant protein; virus envelope protein; VP28 protein, white spot syndrome virus; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; blood cell; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; in vitro study; inoculation; limit of quantitation; mortality; nonhuman; Penaeus monodon; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; vaccination; virus replication; White spot syndrome virus; animal; immunology; Penaeidae; procedures; vaccination; virology; White spot syndrome virus; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Hemocytes; Penaeidae; Recombinant Proteins; Vaccination; Viral Envelope Proteins; White spot syndrome virus 1",Article

Nebulized anticoagulants are thought to have beneficial effects as they could attenuate pulmonary coagulopathy and maybe even affect pulmonary inflammation. A systematic search of the medical literature was performed using terms referring to aspects of the condition ('pneumonia', 'inhalation trauma' and 'ARDS'), the intervention ('nebulized', 'vaporized', and 'aerosolized') and anticoagulants limited to agents that are commercially available and frequently given or tested in critically ill patients ['heparin', 'danaparoid', 'activated protein C' (APC), 'antithrombin' (AT) and 'tissue factor pathway inhibitor' (TFPI)]. The systematic search identified 16 articles reporting on preclinical studies and 11 articles reporting on human trials. All nebulized anticoagulants attenuate pulmonary coagulopathy in preclinical studies using various models for lung injury, but the effects on inflammation are less consistent. Nebulized heparin, danaparoid and TFPI, but not APC and AT also reduced systemic coagulation. Nebulized heparin in lung injury patients shows contradictory results, and there is concern over systemic side effects of this strategy. Future studies need to focus on the way to nebulize anticoagulants, as well as on efficient but safe dosages, and other side effects. © Annals of Translational Medicine.",Anticoagulants; Lung injury; Nebulization,activated protein C; anticoagulant agent; antithrombin; blood clotting factor 7a; danaparoid; heparin; lisofylline; protein C; tissue factor pathway inhibitor; tissue plasminogen activator; adult respiratory distress syndrome; blood clotting disorder; critically ill patient; fibrinolysis; human; intensive care unit; lung infection; lung injury; nebulization; nonhuman; outcome assessment; pneumonia; preclinical study; Review; systematic review,Review

To study phagocytic function, we co-cultured monocytes of normal, non-splenectomized and splenectomized β-thalassemia/HbE individuals with RBCs obtained from normal, non-splenectomized and splenectomized β-thalassemia/HbE individuals. The phagocytic activity of β-thalassemia/HbE monocytes co-cultured with β-thalassemia/HbE RBCs was significantly higher than that of normal monocytes co-cultured with normal RBCs. Upregulation of monocyte miR-155 was observed in β-thalassemia/HbE patients. Increased miR-155 was associated with reductions in BTB and CNC Homology1 (BACH1) target gene expression and increased phagocytic activity of β-thalassemia/HbE monocytes. Taken together, these findings suggested that increased miR-155 expression in activated monocytes leads to enhanced phagocytic activity via BACH-1 regulation in β-thalassemia/HbE. This provides novel insights into the phagocytic clearance of abnormal RBCs in β-thalassemia/HbE. © 2017, The Japanese Society of Hematology.",Activated monocyte; miR-155; Phagocytosis; β-Thalassemia/HbE,"BTB Domain And CNC Homolog 1; CD14 antigen; hemoglobin; microRNA 155; protein; unclassified drug; BACH1 protein, human; basic leucine zipper transcription factor; hemoglobin E; microRNA; MIRN155 microRNA, human; adolescent; adult; Article; beta thalassemia; clinical article; coculture; comparative study; controlled study; erythrocyte; female; gene expression regulation; gene function; gene mutation; gene targeting; hematocrit; hemoglobin blood level; hemoglobin E-beta thalassemia; human; male; mean corpuscular hemoglobin; mean corpuscular volume; molecular pathology; monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; phagocytosis; splenectomy; upregulation; young adult; beta thalassemia; biosynthesis; genetics; metabolism; monocyte; pathology; Adolescent; Adult; Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; beta-Thalassemia; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Hemoglobin E; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Monocytes; Phagocytosis",Article

Objective We conducted this meta-analysis to determine whether there is an association between hearing loss and osteoporosis. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted from studies of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS. Osteoporosis was defined as having a bone mineral density with a T-score of less than −2.5 standard deviation. The outcome was hearing loss as assessed by audiometry or self-reported assessment. Random-effects model and pooled hazard ratio, risk ratio, or odds ratio of hearing loss with 95% confidence intervals were compared between normal bone mineral density and low bone mineral density or osteoporosis. Results A total of 16 articles underwent full-length review. Overall, there was a statistically significant increased odds of hearing loss in the low bone mineral density or osteoporosis group with odds ratio of 1.20 (95% confidence intervals 1.01–1.42, p = 0.04, I2 = 82%, Pheterogeneity = 0.01). However, the study from Helzner et al. reported significantly increase odds of hearing loss in the low bone mineral density in particular area and population included femoral neck of black men 1.37 (95% confidence intervals 1.07–1.76, p = 0.01) and total hip of black men 1.36 (95% confidence intervals 1.05–1.76, p = 0.02). Conclusion Our study proposed the first meta-analysis that demonstrated a probable association between hearing loss and bone mineral density. Osteoporosis could be a risk factor in hearing loss and might play an important role in age-related hearing loss. © 2016 Associação Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cérvico-Facial",Hearing loss; Meta-analysis; Osteoporosis,"Article; audiometry; Black person; bone density; clinical outcome; disease association; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; femoral neck; hearing acuity; hearing impairment; human; male; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; osteolysis; osteoporosis; self report; systematic review; age; complication; conduction deafness; ethnology; female; meta analysis; mixed hearing loss; osteoporosis; perception deafness; physiology; risk factor; sex difference; Age Factors; Bone Density; Female; Hearing Loss, Conductive; Hearing Loss, Mixed Conductive-Sensorineural; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Humans; Male; Osteoporosis; Risk Factors; Sex Factors",Article

The success rates can be markedly decreased because of unavailability of suitable recipient vessels. In order to obtain a reliable flow, recipient vessels away from the zone of fibrosis, radiation, or infection need to be explored. The aim of this report is to present our experience and clinical outcomes using the retrograde flow coming from the distal transverse cervical artery (TCA) as a source for arterial inflow for complex head and neck reconstruction in patients with a vessel-depleted neck. Methods: Between July 2010 and June 2016, nine patients with a vessel-depleted neck underwent secondary head and neck reconstruction using the retrograde TCA as recipient vessel for microanastomosis. The mean age was 49.6 years (range, 36 to 68 years). All patients had previous bilateral neck dissections and all, except one, had also received radiotherapy. Indications included neck contracture release (n = 3), oral (n = 1), mandibular (n = 3) and pharyngoesophageal (n = 2) reconstruction necessitating free anterolateral thigh (n = 3) and medial sural artery (n = 1) perforator flaps, fibula (n = 3) and ileocolon (n = 2) flaps respectively. Results: There was 100% flap survival rate with no re-exploration or any partial flap loss. One case of intra-operative arterial vasospasm at the anastomotic suture line was managed intra-operatively with vein graft interposition. There were no other complications or donor site morbidity during the follow-up period. Conclusions: In a vessel-depleted neck, the reverse flow of the TCA may be a reliable option for complex secondary head and neck reconstruction in selected patients. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,lidocaine; adult; aged; anterolateral thigh flap; artery; artery blood flow; artery spasm; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; case report; cephalic vein; clinical article; clinical outcome; contracture; donor site; end to end anastomosis; follow up; free tissue graft; head and neck surgery; human; hypopharynx cancer; ileocolon flap; internal jugular vein; laryngectomy; latissimus dorsi flap; male; medial sural artery perforator flap; microstomia; microsurgery; middle aged; mouth cancer; neck; neck dissection; perforator flap; peroperative complication; pharyngectomy; priority journal; pulsatile flow; radial forearm flap; range of motion; retrograde transverse cervical artery; surgical patient; survival rate; vein graft,Article

One of these risk factors is chronic inflammation. Several recent studies have supported the association between low bone mineral density (BMD) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which comprises a spectrum of disorders involving liver inflammation. However, conflicting evidence regarding this association has been obtained thus far. We, therefore, conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies to show the association between NAFLD and BMD. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase were searched from database inception to November 2014 for all observational studies evaluating the association between NAFLD or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and bone mass, BMD, or osteoporosis. All patients were ≥18 years of age and had no other cause of liver disease, osteoporosis, or pathological bone disease at baseline. Risk factors were NAFLD and NASH; control subjects were individuals without NAFLD. Eleven articles underwent full-length review. Data were extracted from five cross-sectional studies involving 1276 participants; 638 had NAFLD. The main meta-analysis showed no significant difference in BMD between patients with fatty liver disease and controls. Among all variables analyzed, body mass index had the strongest and most significant predictive effect on the difference in BMD. Controversy exists regarding the effect of BMD on NAFLD. Further studies are required to fully show this relationship. © 2016, The Japanese Society for Bone and Mineral Research and Springer Japan.",Bone mineral density; Meta-analysis; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; Osteoporosis,"Article; body mass; bone disease; bone mass; disease association; fatty liver; human; liver disease; meta analysis; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; nonalcoholic fatty liver; osteoporosis; priority journal; publishing; quality control; risk factor; systematic review; bone density; case control study; complication; cross-sectional study; female; health care quality; insulin resistance; nonalcoholic fatty liver; osteoporosis; Body Mass Index; Bone Density; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Osteoporosis; Publication Bias; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Risk Factors",Article

The association between malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth has yet to be comprehensively quantified. We aimed to quantify the association between malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth, and to assess the influence of malaria endemicity on the association. Methods We did a systematic review of the association between confirmed malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth. We included population-based cross-sectional, cohort, or case-control studies (in which cases were stillbirths or perinatal deaths), and randomised controlled trials of malaria in pregnancy interventions, identified before Feb 28, 2017. We excluded studies in which malaria in pregnancy was not confirmed by PCR, light microscopy, rapid diagnostic test, or histology. The primary outcome was stillbirth. We pooled estimates of the association between malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth using meta-analysis. We used meta-regression to assess the influence of endemicity. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, protocol number CRD42016038742. Findings We included 59 studies of 995 records identified, consisting of 141 415 women and 3387 stillbirths. Plasmodium falciparum malaria detected at delivery in peripheral samples increased the odds of stillbirth (odds ratio [OR] 1·81 [95% CI 1·42–2·30]; I2=26·1%; 34 estimates), as did P falciparum detected in placental samples (OR 1·95 [1·48–2·57]; I2=33·6%; 31 estimates). P falciparum malaria detected and treated during pregnancy was also associated with stillbirth, but to a lesser extent (OR 1·47 [95% CI 1·13–1·92]; 19 estimates). Plasmodium vivax malaria increased the odds of stillbirth when detected at delivery (2·81 [0·77–10·22]; three estimates), but not when detected and treated during pregnancy (1·09 [0·76–1·57]; four estimates). The association between P falciparum malaria in pregnancy and stillbirth was two times greater in areas of low-to-intermediate endemicity than in areas of high endemicity (ratio of ORs 1·96 [95% CI 1·34–2·89]). Assuming all women with malaria are still parasitaemic at delivery, an estimated 20% of the 1 059 700 stillbirths in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan Africa are attributed to P falciparum malaria in pregnancy; the population attributable fraction decreases to 12%, assuming all women with malaria are treated during pregnancy. Interpretation P falciparum and P vivax malaria in pregnancy both increase stillbirth risk. The risk of malaria-associated stillbirth is likely to increase as endemicity declines. There is a pressing need for context-appropriate, evidence-based interventions for malaria in pregnancy in low-endemicity settings.

We assessed the effect of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women on neurodevelopment of their offspring in areas where schoolchildren were iodine sufficient. Methods In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, pregnant women in Bangalore, India, and Bangkok, Thailand, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 200 μg iodine orally once a day or placebo until delivery. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by site. Co-primary outcomes were verbal and performance IQ scores on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) and the global executive composite score from the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) in the children at age 5–6 years. The trial was double-blinded; some unmasking took place at age 2 years for an interim analysis, but participants and nearly all investigators remained masked to group assignment until age 5–6 years. Analysis was by intention to treat using mixed-effects models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00791466. Findings Between Nov 18, 2008, and March 12, 2011, 832 women entered the trial at a mean gestational age of 10·7 weeks (SD 2·7); median urinary iodine concentration was 131 μg/L (IQR 81–213). Mean compliance with supplementation was 87%, assessed by monthly tablet counts. 313 children (iodine group, n=159; placebo group, n=154) were analysed for verbal and performance IQ with WPPSI-III and 315 (iodine group, n=159; placebo group, n=156) for overall executive function with BRIEF-P. Mean WPPSI-III scores for verbal IQ were 89·5 (SD 9·8) in the iodine group and 90·2 (9·8) in the placebo group (difference −0·7, 95% CI −2·9 to 1·5; p=0·77), and for performance IQ were 97·5 (12·5) in the iodine group and 99·1 (13·4) in the placebo group (difference −1·6, −4·5 to 1·3; p=0·44). The mean BRIEF-P global executive composite score was 90·6 (26·2) in the iodine group and 91·5 (27·0) in the placebo group (difference −0·9, −6·8 to 5·0; p=0·74). The frequency of adverse events did not differ between groups during gestation or at delivery: 24 women in the iodine group and 28 in the placebo group reported adverse events (iodine group: abortion, n=20; blighted ovum, and n=2; intrauterine death, n=2; placebo group: abortion, n=22; blighted ovum, n=1; intrauterine death, n=2; early neonatal death, n=1; and neonatal death, n=2).

Several epidemiologic studies have suggested that patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection might be at an increased risk of gallstones. However, the data on this relationship remain inconclusive. This meta-analysis was conducted with the aims to summarize all available evidence. Methods: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to May 2016. Studies that reported relative risks, odd ratios, or hazard ratios comparing the risk of gallstones among HCV-infected patients versus subjects without HCV infection were included. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. Results: Eleven studies met our eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The pooled OR of gallstones in HCV-infected patients versus subjects without HCV infection was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.35 to 2.48, I2= 89%). Subgroup analysis showed that significant risk was increased for both male (pooled OR of 2.07, 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.76) and female (pooled OR of 3.00, 95% CI, 2.16 to 4.17). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated a significantly increased risk of gallstones among HCV-infected patients. Further studies are required to clarify how this risk should be addressed in the clinical picture. © 2017 Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Cholelithiasis; gallbladder stones; gallstones; Hepatitis C virus; meta-analysis,Article; confounding variable; disease association; gallstone; health hazard; hepatitis C; human; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; sex; systematic review,Article

The objectives are also to determine policy implications and to recommend the specific contexts suitable for each modelling choice by using specific illustrative cases on biofuels. Methods: Consequential and attributional modelling approaches are chosen for life cycle greenhouse gas emission assessment of several bioenergy options. The assessed functional unit is 1 MJ of energy from molasses-based ethanol, palm-based biodiesel and electricity production from rice straw. The fossil fuel comparators are gasoline (for molasses-based ethanol), diesel (for palm-based biodiesel) and coal and gas (for rice straw). The substituted and substituting product systems are modelled under the global and national markets depending on the market delimitation of each product. Results and discussion: The climate change mitigation potentials when using different approaches are dissimilar, because the affected product systems being included in the analysis are not the same. The palm biodiesel could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The molasses-based ethanol and rice straw-based electricity may or may not mitigate the climate change, since it depends on the methodological choices as well as the baseline situations of the product systems being investigated. The main characteristics of consequential modelling as additionality and the inclusion of only actually affected processes under market-based mechanisms while those of attributional modelling as specification and attribution/allocation have limitations. The limitations lead to potential risks on unintended and undesirable consequences (for the attributional model), unfairness and sub-optimisation (for the consequential model) in policy recommendations. Conclusions: This research clearly illustrates how certain modelling choices affect the climate change mitigation potentials of biomass-based fuels in comparison with fossil energy. Specific questions and conditions which could be more suitable for each modelling choice are addressed. The attributional modelling is more suitable for national environmental taxation and emission labelling/accounting for import-export, while the consequential modelling is more appropriate for new production development and eco-design. Due to the potential environmental risks arising from the modelling limitations, the consideration of both the widely applied approaches could support decisions more comprehensively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Attributional modelling approach; Biofuel; Consequential modelling approach; Direct land use change; Indirect land use change,alcohol; biodiesel; biofuel; coal; fossil fuel; molasses; Article; bioenergy; carbon footprint; climate change; electricity; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; gas; life cycle; priority journal; strategic planning,Article

Guidelines for the most appropriate method comparison tools as well as their acceptable limits are lacking and not standardized for CD4 counting technologies. Methods: Different method comparison tools were applied to a previously published CD4 dataset (n = 150 data pairs) evaluating five different CD4 counting technologies (TruCOUNT, Dual Platform, FACSCount, Easy CD4, CyFlow) on a single specimen. Bland–Altman, percentage similarity, percent difference, concordance correlation, sensitivity, specificity and misclassification method comparison tools were applied as well as visualization of agreement with Passing Bablock and Bland–Altman scatter plots. Results: The FACSCount (median CD4 = 245 cells/µl) was considered the reference for method comparison. An algorithm was developed using best practices of the most applicable method comparison tools, and together with a modified heat map was found useful for method comparison of CD4 qualitative and quantitative results. The algorithm applied the concordance correlation for overall accuracy and precision, then standard deviation of the absolute bias and percentage similarity coefficient of variation to identify agreement, and lastly sensitivity and misclassification rates for clinical relevance. Conclusion: Combining method comparison tools is more useful in evaluating CD4 technologies compared to a reference CD4. This algorithm should be further validated using CD4 external quality assessment data and studies with larger sample sizes. © 2017 International Clinical Cytometry Society. © 2017 International Clinical Cytometry Society",Bland–Altman; CD4 technology; concordance correlation; method comparison; misclassification; percentage similarity; statistical algorithm,algorithm; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; classification; human; intermethod comparison; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis,Article

The aim of the present study was to report the long-term outcomes of LAGB and compare the outcomes between the different revision procedures. Methods: All patients who underwent LAGB in a large bariatric center in Asia between May 2002 and April 2011 were included. Interval between primary LAGB to the revision operation, the reason and type of revision surgery were identified and analyzed. Results: A total of 275 consecutive patients were included. All of the procedures were completed laparoscopically with no major complications. The percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 10-year follow-up was 45%. In this study, 53 patients (19.3%) had revision surgery, including with 26 single anastomosis (mini-) gastric bypass (R-LSAGB) (49%), 17 sleeve gastrectomy (R-LSG) (32.1%), 9 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (R-LRYGB) (17%), and 1 other procedure (1.9%). A major complication occurred in 6 patients (11.3%). All of the follow-up patients with revision surgeries had %EWL > 50% at the 2-year follow-up. R-LSAGB patients achieved better weight loss than those who underwent R-LSG and R-LRYGB (p = 0.001). Conclusions: The long-term result for weight loss after LAGB is unsatisfactory. The revision of failed LAGB to other bariatric surgeries is safe and can be performed in one stage with a low complication rate.

UNAIDS encourages all nations to monitor progress toward elimination of this problem. This study measured the level of stigmatizing attitudes toward people living with HIV (PLHIV) among Thai adults in the general population using recommended global tools. Methods: Data from the 5th National Health Examination Survey, conducted in 2014 were used. The survey utilized six questions recommended by the Global Stigma and Discrimination Indicator Working Group and was administered to participants aged 20–59 years old. All analyses were weighted to take into account of the probability of sampling the same-age Thai population. Factors related to a discriminatory attitude according to UNAIDS, defined as agreed to at least one of the two discriminatory issues, were evaluated using Chi square tested and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Of the 10,522 respondents, the most prevalent stigmatizing attitude was anticipated stigma (76.9%), followed by perceived stigma (69.2%), fear of HIV infection (57.0%), and social judgment (38.2%). Fifty-eight point six percent had discriminatory attitudes according to the UNAIDS global indicator. Independent predictors were being female (AOR = 1.21: 95% CI 1.14–1.29), aged 20–39 (AOR = 1.19: 95% CI 1.09–1.30) or 50–59 (AOR = 1.18: 95%CI 1.12–1.26), being Muslim (AOR = 2.03: 95%CI 1.55–2.66), earning < 10,000 Baht/month (AOR = 0.93: 95%CI 0.88–0.99), and living in the Northeast (AOR = 1.67: 95%CI 1.39–2.00) or in Bangkok (AOR = 1.73: 95%CI 1.45–2.07). Conclusions: More than half of the general adult Thai population had stigmatizing attitudes toward PLHIV. The study provided valuable baseline information which could be used as comparison for follow-up surveys with other countries. Interventions to improve Thai society’s knowledge and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS are urgently needed. © 2017 Srithanaviboonchai et al.

Most of the reports of reconstruction after scapulectomy are from a single institution. In the present study, we investigated functional outcomes after total scapulectomy in a multicenter study in The Eastern Asian Musculoskeletal Oncology Group (EAMOG). Thirty-three patients who underwent total scapulectomy were registered at EAMOG affiliated hospitals. The patients were separated into no reconstruction group (n=8), humeral suspension group (n=15) and prosthesis group (n=10). Functional outcome was assessed by the Enneking score. One-way ANOVA was used to compare parameters between the patient groups. Complications included five local recurrences, one superficial infection, one dislocation and one clavicle protrusion. The average follow-up period was 43.5 months. The average active flexion range was 45.8° (0–120°), and 37.1° in abduction (0–120°). The mean total functional score was 22.9 out of 30 (15–29), which is a satisfactory score following resection of the shoulder girdle. There were significant differences in reconstruction methods for active range of motion. Bony reconstruction provided better range of motion in this study. There was a variety of reconstruction methods after scapulectomy in the eastern Asian countries. Although better functional score was obtained using scapular prosthesis or recycled bone and prosthesis composite grafting, postoperative function is still lower than preoperative function. Modified designed prosthesis with or without combination of recycle bone or allograft would restore the lost shoulder function in the future. © 2016 The Authors",Functional outcome; Limb salvage surgery; Megaprosthesis; Recycled bone graft; Sarcoma; Scapulectomy,abduction; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; bone graft; clinical article; clinical outcome; disease severity; East Asian; excision; female; follow up; human; male; musculoskeletal disease; musculoskeletal tumor; outcome assessment; priority journal; range of motion; recurrent disease; retrospective study; shoulder girdle; superinfection,Article

Results: Mean (standard deviation) elasticity values for HCC, liver metastasis, and normal liver tissue were 51.45 (14.96), 49.89 (13.82), and 6.63 (1.65) kilopascal, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found between the elasticity values of HCC and liver metastasis with normal liver tissue. Based on the receiver operating characteristics analysis, 18.25 kilopascal may differentiate the malignant focal liver lesions from the normal liver tissue with both sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Conclusion: Shear wave ultrasound elastography may be able to differentiate HCC and liver metastasis from normal liver tissue based on the tissue elasticity values. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",hepatocellular carcinoma; liver metastases; shear wave ultrasound elastography; tissue elasticity,alanine aminotransferase; adult; Article; body mass; clinical article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; elasticity; feasibility study; female; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver injury; liver metastasis; liver stiffness; liver tissue; male; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; shear wave elastography; tumor differentiation,Article

We developed the ACCESS application and determined its inter-rater and intra-rater reliability in the Stroke Investigative Research and Educational Network (SIREN) study to assess its suitability for multicenter studies. Methods One hundred randomly selected stroke imaging reports from 5 SIREN sites were re-evaluated by 4 trained independent raters to determine the inter-rater reliability of the ACCESS (version 12.0) software for stroke phenotyping. To determine intra-rater reliability, 6 raters reviewed the same cases previously reported by them after a month of interval. Ischemic stroke was classified using the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP), Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST), and Atherosclerosis, Small-vessel disease, Cardiac source, Other cause (ASCO) protocols, while hemorrhagic stroke was classified using the Structural lesion, Medication, Amyloid angiopathy, Systemic disease, Hypertensive angiopathy and Undetermined (SMASH-U) protocol in ACCESS. Agreement among raters was measured with Cohen's kappa statistics. Results For primary stroke type, inter-rater agreement was.98 (95% confidence interval [CI],.94-1.00), while intra-rater agreement was 1.00 (95% CI, 1.00). For OCSP subtypes, inter-rater agreement was.97 (95% CI,.92-1.00) for the partial anterior circulation infarcts,.92 (95% CI,.76-1.00) for the total anterior circulation infarcts, and excellent for both lacunar infarcts and posterior circulation infarcts. Intra-rater agreement was.97 (.90-1.00), while inter-rater agreement was.93 (95% CI,.84-1.00) for TOAST subtypes. Inter-rater agreement ranged between.78 (cardioembolic) and.91 (large artery atherosclerotic) for ASCO subtypes and was.80 (95% CI,.56-1.00) for SMASH-U subtypes. Conclusion The ACCESS application facilitates a concordant and reproducible classification of stroke subtypes by multiple investigators, making it suitable for clinical use and multicenter research. © 2017 National Stroke Association",Africa; developing country; DICOM application; ischemic stroke; phenotyping; reporting software intracerebral hemorrhage; Stroke,adult; Article; brain atherosclerosis; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; computer assisted tomography; disease classification; Doppler ultrasonography; echocardiography; electrocardiography; female; human; imaging software; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; major clinical study; male; markup language; middle aged; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; priority journal; stroke patient,Article

Although Vip3Aa has been effectively used as part of integrated pest management strategies, the mechanism of the toxin remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of pH in a range from 5.0 to 10.0 on the pore-forming activity of the trypsin activated Vip3Aa (actVip3Aa) by in vitro pore-forming assays. Based on calcein release assay, actVip3Aa could permeabilize the artificial neutral liposomes under all the pH tested, except pH 10.0. The maximum membrane permeability of actVip3Aa was detected at pH 8.0 and the permeability decreased and abolished when exposing to acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. The planar lipid bilayer experiment revealed that actVip3Aa formed ion channels at pH 5.0–8.0 but no current signals were detected at pH 10.0, consistent with the observation from calcein release assay. The toxin formed ion channels with a diameter of 1.4 nm at pH 8.0 and pore size was gradually decreased when reducing the pH. This study provided a view of the molecular mechanism of Vip3Aa by which the pore-forming activity is regulated by pH. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bacillus thuringiensis; Ion channels; Membrane insertion; Planar lipid bilayers; Pore formation; Vip3Aa,"Bacillus thuringiensis toxin; calcein; ion channel; liposome; monomer; trypsin; unclassified drug; Vip3Aa protein; bacterial protein; Vip3A protein, Bacillus thuringiensis; Article; Bacillus thuringiensis; controlled study; lipid bilayer; membrane permeability; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; protein conformation; protein degradation; protein structure; biological pest control; cell membrane permeability; chemistry; drug effects; in vitro study; metabolism; physiology; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Membrane Permeability; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; In Vitro Techniques; Lipid Bilayers; Pest Control, Biological; Proteolysis; Trypsin",Article

Here we aimed to study how production of p-coumaric acid, a precursor of multiple secondary aromatic metabolites, influences the cellular metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We evaluated the growth and p-coumaric acid production in batch and chemostat cultivations and analyzed the transcriptome and intracellular metabolome during steady state in low- and high-producers of p-coumaric acid in two strain backgrounds, S288c or CEN.PK. We found that the same genetic modifications resulted in higher production of p-coumaric acid in the CEN.PK background than in the S288c background. Moreover, the CEN.PK strain was less affected by the genetic engineering as was evident from fewer changes in the transcription profile and intracellular metabolites concentrations. Surprisingly, for both strains we found the largest transcriptional changes in genes involved in transport of amino acids and sugars, which were downregulated. Additionally, in S288c amino acid and protein biosynthesis processes were also affected. We systematically overexpressed or deleted genes with significant transcriptional changes in CEN.PK low and high-producing strains. The knockout of some of the downregulated transporters triggered a 20–50% improvement in the synthesis of p-CA in the CEN.PK high-producing strain. This study demonstrates the importance of transporters in the engineering of cell factories for production of small molecules. © 2017 The Authors",Metabolome data; p-Coumaric acid; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Transcriptome; Transporters,Amino acids; Biochemistry; Genes; Genetic engineering; Metabolism; Metabolites; Transcription; Yeast; Genetic modifications; Intracellular metabolites; Metabolomes; P-coumaric acid; Transcription profiles; Transcriptional changes; Transcriptomes; Transporters; Cell engineering; amino acid; carbohydrate; para coumaric acid; transcriptome; Article; comparative study; DNA modification; down regulation; fungal strain; gene overexpression; genetic engineering; genetic transcription; metabolism; metabolome; nonhuman; physiological process; priority journal; protein synthesis; species cultivation; yeast,Article

Second-generation antihistamines are the first-line treatment option in the management of allergic rhinitis and urticaria. International guidelines describe the management of these conditions; however, clinicians perceive the additional need to tailor treatment according to patient profiles. This study serves as a consensus of experts from several countries in APAC (Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam), which aims to describe the unmet needs, practical considerations, challenges, and key decision factors when determining optimal second-generation antihistamines for patients with allergic rhinitis and/or urticaria. Methods: Specialists from allergology, dermatology, and otorhinolaryngology were surveyed on practical considerations and key decision points when treating patients with allergic rhinitis and/or urticaria. Results: Clinicians felt the need for additional tools for diagnosis of these diseases and a single drug with all preferred features of an antihistamine. Challenges in treatment include lack of clinician and patient awareness and compliance, financial constraints, and treatment for special patient populations such as those with concomitant disease. Selection of optimal second-generation antihistamines depends on many factors, particularly drug safety and efficacy, impact on psychomotor abilities, and sedation. Country-specific considerations include drug availability and cost-effectiveness. Survey results reveal bilastine as a preferred choice due to its high efficacy and safety, suitability for special patient populations, and the lack of sedative effects. Conclusions: Compliance to the international guidelines is present among allergists, dermatologists and otorhinolaryngologists; however, this is lower amongst general practitioners (GPs). To increase awareness, allergy education programs targeted at GPs and patients may be beneficial. Updates to the existing international guidelines are suggested in APAC to reflect appropriate management for different patient profiles and varying symptoms of allergic rhinitis and urticaria. © 2017 The Author(s).",Allergic rhinitis; Antihistamines; Bilastine; Treatment algorithm; Urticaria,antihistaminic agent; bilastine; cetirizine; desloratadine; erythromycin; fexofenadine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; ketoconazole; levocetirizine; loratadine; rupatadine; allergic conjunctivitis; allergic rhinitis; Article; consensus; cost effectiveness analysis; dermatologist; drug choice; drug efficacy; drug safety; education program; general practitioner; Hong Kong; human; immunologist; Malaysia; otorhinolaryngology; patient attitude; Philippines; physician attitude; practice guideline; protocol compliance; psychomotor development; rhinoconjunctivitis; severe renal impairment; Singapore; somnolence; Thailand; urticaria; Viet Nam,Article

Cardinal features of OSA, including intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation, have been linked to abnormal glucose metabolism in laboratory-based experiments. OSA has also been linked to the development of incident type 2 diabetes. The relationship between OSA and type 2 diabetes may be bidirectional in nature given that diabetic neuropathy can affect central control of respiration and upper airway neural reflexes, promoting sleep-disordered breathing. Despite the strong association between OSA and type 2 diabetes, the effect of treatment with CPAP on markers of glucose metabolism has been conflicting. Variability with CPAP adherence may be one of the key factors behind these conflicting results. Finally, accumulating data suggest an association between OSA and type 1 diabetes as well as gestational diabetes. This review explores the role of OSA in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, glucose metabolism dysregulation, and the impact of OSA treatment on glucose metabolism.

Firstly, MLPs were prepared from the precipitation of iron oxide, polymerization using initiator, and adsorption of aminodextran (AMD) so as to provide amino-functionalized MLPs. Furthermore, amino-containing polymer particles (PPs) were prepared by emulsifier-free polymerization and encapsulated with fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) for use as a signaling support. Subsequently, poly(maleic anhydride-alt-methyl vinyl ether) (PMAMVE) copolymer was effectively used for rapid and simple grafting of amino-modified DNA primers onto the surface of amino-functionalized particles thereby providing a promising method for particle immobilization. Herein, primer-grafted particles were applied in the amplification of the Pfg377 gene using the PCR approach. After amplification, PCR products containing PMAMVE-grafted MLPs and QDs-PPs were separated using a magnet and examined via a fluorescence microscope. PMAMVE-grafted particles were not found to inhibit the PCR reaction while facilitating efficient fluorescent detection of the PCR product.

However, little is known about the bleeding risk from heparin-bridging therapy itself. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched through January 2017 for studies that compared the risk of PPB in patients who received heparin-bridging therapy in lieu of antithrombotic agents for colonoscopic polypectomy and those who discontinued antithrombotic agents without receiving heparin. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model, generic inverse variance method. Between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Results: A total of five studies consisting of 2601 patients were identified. A significantly increased risk of PPB among bridged patients compared to non-bridged patients was demonstrated with a pooled OR of 8.29 (95% CI, 4.96–13.87). Statistical heterogeneity was low with I2 of 0%. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated a significantly increased risk of PPB among patients who underwent colonoscopic polypectomy and received heparin-bridging therapy in lieu of antithrombotic agents compared to patients who did not receive it. © 2017 Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society",anticoagulant; colonoscopic polypectomy; heparin; post-polypectomy bleeding; warfarin,anticoagulant agent; heparin; bridging therapy; drug therapy; endoscopic polypectomy; heparinization; human; Japanese (people); meta analysis; patient risk; postoperative hemorrhage; Review; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; surgical risk; systematic review,Review

Thorough understandings of immunological properties of the Mtb's surface components are essential for the development of tuberculosis treatment and prevention. Unfortunately, the accessibility to the molecules on the surface of Mtb is limited by the structural complexity due to their various macromolecular nature and the hazard of culturing Mtb. In this study, we reveal a practical synthesis of lipomannan (LM) backbone polysaccharides – the core glycans found on Mtb's surface. A rapid synthetic approach based on a controlled polymerization was developed for the chemical synthesis of mannopyranans, the core structure of LM. The size of the LM glycans can be controlled by using specific monomer concentrations in addition to stereo- and regioselectivity derived from the versatile tricyclic orthoester mannose monomer. The immunological properties of the synthesized mannopyranans were investigated and their adjuvant potential was revealed. The adjuvanticity mechanism of the synthetic mannopyranans appears to involve the NF-κB and inflammasome pathways. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",lipomannan; mannosyl tricyclic orthoester monomer; Mycobacterium tuberculosis surface; vaccine adjuvant; ​mannan back-bone polysaccharides,Monomers; Vaccines; Controlled polymerization; Host immune response; Immunological properties; Lipomannan; Monomer concentration; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Structural complexity; Vaccine adjuvants; Polysaccharides,Article

Identification of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) LBJ_2271 protein containing immunogenic epitopes and the discovery of the LBJ_2271 ortholog in Leptospira serovar Sejroe, KU_Sej_R21_2271, led to further studies of the antigenic immune properties of KU_Sej_LRR_2271. The recombinant hybrid (rh) protein was created and expressed from a hybrid PCR fragment of KU_Sej_R21_2271 fused with DNA encoding the LBJ_2271 signal sequence for targeting protein as a membrane-anchoring protein. The fusion DNA was cloned into pET160/GW/D-TOPO® to form the pET160_hKU_R21_2271 plasmid. The plasmid was used to express the rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 protein in Escherichia coli BL21 Star™ (DE3). The expressed protein was immunologically detected by Western blotting and immunoreactivity detection with hyperimmune sera, T cell epitope prediction by HLA allele and epitope peptide binding affinity, and potential T cell reactivity analysis. The immunogenic epitopes of the protein were evaluated and verified by HLA allele and epitope peptide complex structure molecular docking. Among fourteen best allele epitopes of this protein, binding affinity values of 12 allele epitopes remained unchanged compared to LBJ_2271. Two epitopes for alleles HLA-A0202 and -A0301 had higher IC50 values, while T cell reactivity values of these peptides were better than values from LBJ_2271 epitopes. Eight of twelve epitope peptides had positive T-cell reactivity scores. Although the molecular docking of two epitopes, 3FPLLKEFLV11/47FPLLKEFLV55 and 50KLSTVPEGV58, into an HLA-A0202 model revealed a good fit in the docked structures, 50KLSTVPEGV58 and 94KLSTVPEEV102 are still considered as the proteins' best epitopes for allele HLA-A0202. The results of this study showed that rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 protein contained natural immunological properties that should be further examined with respect to antigenic immune stimulation for vaccine development to prevent prevalent leptospiral serovar infection in Thailand. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Epitopes; LBJ_2271 ortholog; Leptospirosis; Leucine-rich repeat (LRR); Molecular docking; T cell reactivity,epitope; HLA antigen; allele; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; Article; binding affinity; controlled study; Escherichia coli; expression vector; IC50; immune response; immunogenicity; immunoreactivity; Leptospira; Leptospira borgpetersenii; molecular cloning; molecular docking; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein purification; protein structure; protein targeting; T lymphocyte; Thailand; Western blotting,Article

In this study, we determined the potential of endemic Salmonella infections to reduce the reproductive success of blue (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great (Parus major) tits by correlating eggshell infection with reproductive parameters. The fifth egg of each clutch was collected from nest boxes in 19 deciduous forest fragments. Out of the 101 sampled eggs, 7 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were recovered. The low bacterial prevalence was reflected by a similarly low serological prevalence in the fledglings. In this study with a relatively small sample size, presence of Salmonella did not affect reproductive parameters (egg volume, clutch size, number of nestlings and number of fledglings), nor the health status of the fledglings. However, in order to clarify the impact on health and reproduction a larger number of samples have to be analyzed. Phage typing showed that the isolates belonged to the definitive phage types (DT) 193 and 99, and multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) demonstrated a high similarity among the tit isolates, but distinction to human isolates. These findings suggest the presence of passerine-adapted Salmonella strains in free-ranging tit populations with host pathogen co-existence. © 2017 Boonyarittichaikij et al.

Gastrointestinal helminths were isolated from 14 species of rodents (569 individuals) trapped from different habitats (forest, dry land, rain-fed land and human settlements) in four provinces of Cambodia (Krong Preah Sihanouk, Mondolkiri, Pursat and Steung Treng). The average prevalence of parasitic infection was 58.5% (range, 16.0-64.7%), and 19 helminth taxa were identified in total. Trichostrongylid nematodes were the most prevalent (25.8%), followed by Raillietina sp. (14.1%), Gongylonema neoplasticum (10.7%), Syphacia muris (9.8%) and Hymenolepis diminuta (9.6%). Potential rodent-borne zoonotic helminths were also identified, and the risks of helminthiasis were discussed. The status of helminth infection and species diversity in rodents from settlements were significantly lower than in rodents from forest and peri-domesticated habitats, which indicates that habitat alteration might affect helminth infection and diversity in rodent hosts. Generalized linear models revealed that host attributes (host species and maturity) and environmental factors (habitat and geographical location) were explanatory variables for helminth infection in these rodents. Using network analyses, we showed that the oriental house rat, Rattus tanezumi, was the most central host in the rodent-helminth assemblage, based on the number of helminth taxa it shared with other rodent species. Therefore, R. tanezumi could play an important role in rodent-helminth interactions and helminth transmission to other rodent hosts. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,Article; Cambodia; community ecology; controlled study; fauna; Gongylonema; Gongylonema neoplasticum; helminthiasis; Hymenolepis diminuta; intestine; land use; nematode; nonhuman; parasitosis; prevalence; Raillietina; rat; species richness; Syphacia muris; Trichostrongyloidea; urbanization,Article

This study describes the profile of junior doctors in adult state intensive care units in Sri Lanka, a lower middle-income country. Materials and Methods: This was a national cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-administered electronic questionnaire. Results: Five hundred and thirty-nine doctors in 93 Intensive Care Units (ICUs) were contacted, generating 207 responses. Just under half of the respondents (93, 47%) work exclusively in ICUs. Most junior doctors (150, 75.8%) had no previous exposure to anesthesia and 134 (67.7%) had no previous ICU experience while 116 (60.7%) ICU doctors wished to specialize in critical care. However, only a few (12, 6.3%) doctors had completed a critical care diploma course. There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) between the self-assessed confidence of anesthetic background junior doctors and non-anesthetists. The overall median competency for doctors improves with the length of ICU experience and is statistically significant (P < 0.05). ICU postings were less happy and more stressful compared to the last non-ICU posting (P < 0.05 for both). The vast majority, i.e., 173 (88.2%) of doctors felt the care provided for patients in their ICUs was good, very good, or excellent while 71 doctors (36.2%) would be happy to recommend the ICU where they work to a relative with the highest possible score of 10. Conclusion: Measures to improve training opportunities for these doctors and strategies to improve their retention in ICUs need to be addressed. © 2017 Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Critical care; junior doctors; lower middle-income country; resource-limited setting; training,adult; anesthesia; female; human; intensive care unit; male; middle income country; questionnaire; Sri Lanka,Article

We aimed to determine the optimal cut-off points of pretreatment volumetric FDG-PET/CT parameters in predicting overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced NSCLC and to recommend imaging biomarkers appropriate for routine clinical applications. Methods: Patients with inoperable stage IIB/III NSCLC enrolled in ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 were included. Pretreatment FDG-PET scans were quantified using semiautomatic adaptive contrast-oriented thresholding and local-background partial-volume-effect-correction algorithms. For each patient, the following indices were measured: metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), SUVmax, SUVmean, partial-volume-corrected TLG (pvcTLG), and pvcSUVmean for the whole-body, primary tumor, and regional lymph nodes. The association between each index and patient outcome was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Optimal cut-off points were estimated using recursive binary partitioning in a conditional inference framework and used in Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank testing. The discriminatory ability of each index was examined using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and corresponding area under the curve (AUC(t)). Results: The study included 196 patients. Pretreatment whole-body and primary tumor MTV, TLG, and pvcTLG were independently prognostic of OS. Optimal cut-off points were 175.0, 270.9, and 35.5 cm3 for whole-body TLG, pvcTLG, and MTV, and were 168.2, 239.8, and 17.4 cm3 for primary tumor TLG, pvcTLG, and MTV, respectively. In time-dependent ROC analysis, AUC(t) for MTV and TLG were uniformly higher than that of SUV measures over all time points. Primary tumor and whole-body parameters demonstrated similar patterns of separation for those patients above versus below the optimal cut-off points in Kaplan-Meier curves and in time-dependent ROC analysis. Conclusion: We demonstrated that pretreatment whole-body and primary tumor volumetric FDG-PET/CT parameters, including MTV, TLG, and pvcTLG, are strongly prognostic for OS in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, and have similar discriminatory ability. Therefore, we believe that, after validation in future trials, the derived optimal cut-off points for primary tumor volumetric FDG-PET/CT parameters, or their more refined versions, could be incorporated into routine clinical practice, and may provide more accurate prognostication and staging based on tumor metabolic features. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Clinical trial; FDG-PET; Metabolic tumor volume; Non-small cell lung cancer; Risk stratification,carboplatin; cisplatin; etoposide; fluorodeoxyglucose; paclitaxel; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; chemoradiotherapy; cohort analysis; cone beam computed tomography; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; lymph node; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; non small cell lung cancer; outcome assessment; overall survival; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; total lesion glycolysis; tumor volume; very elderly,Article

New global development strategies are sorely needed for biotechnologies such as genomics and their applications toward precision medicine without borders. Moreover, diffusion of genomic medicine globally cannot adhere to a ""one-size-fits-all-countries"" development strategy, in the same way that drug treatments should be customized. This begs a timely, difficult but crucial question: How should developing countries, and the resource-limited regions of developed countries, invest in genomic medicine? Although a full-scale investment in infrastructure from discovery to the translational implementation of genomic science is ideal, this may not always be feasible in all countries at all times. A simple ""transplantation of genomics"" from developed to developing countries is unlikely to be feasible. Nor should developing countries be seen as simple recipients and beneficiaries of genomic medicine developed elsewhere because important advances in genomic medicine have materialized in developing countries as well. There are several noteworthy examples of genomic medicine success stories involving resource-limited settings that are contextualized and described in this global genomic medicine innovation analysis. In addition, we outline here a new long-term development strategy for global genomic medicine in a way that recognizes the individual country's pressing public health priorities and disease burdens. We term this approach the ""Fast-Second Winner"" model of innovation that supports innovation commencing not only ""upstream"" of discovery science but also ""mid-stream,"" building on emerging highly promising biomarker and diagnostic candidates from the global science discovery pipeline, based on the unique needs of each country. A mid-stream entry into innovation can enhance collective learning from other innovators' mistakes upstream in discovery science and boost the probability of success for translation and implementation when resources are limited. This à la carte model of global innovation and development strategy offers multiple entry points into the global genomics innovation ecosystem for developing countries, whether or not extensive and expensive discovery infrastructures are already in place. Ultimately, broadening our thinking beyond the linear model of innovation will help us to enable the vision and practice of genomics without borders in both developed and resource-limited settings. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",developing countries; Fast-Second Winner; precision medicine; public health genomic; Strategy for global biotechnology development,connexin 26; Article; disease burden; gene mutation; genetic disorder; genomics; Ghana; hearing impairment; human; Medline; noise; priority journal; public health; sex difference; systematic review,Article

We compared a new once daily formulation of raltegravir to the currently marketed twice daily formulation. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3, non-inferiority study, we enrolled participants aged 18 years or older with HIV-1 RNA of 1000 or more copies per mL and no previous antiretroviral treatment at 139 sites worldwide. We randomly assigned participants (2:1) via an interactive voice and web response system to raltegravir 1200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) orally once daily or raltegravir 400 mg (one tablet) orally twice daily, each with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine orally once daily, for up to 96 weeks. A computer-generated allocation schedule stratified randomisation by screening HIV-1 RNA value and co-infection with hepatitis B or C. Participants, sponsor personnel, investigators, and study site personnel involved in the treatment or evaluation of the participants were unaware of the treatment group assignments. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 40 copies per mL at week 48 assessed with the US Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI was greater than −10%. We assessed efficacy and safety in all participants who received one dose or more of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02131233. Findings Between May 26, 2014, and Dec 5, 2014, 802 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned, 533 to once daily treatment and 269 to twice daily; 797 received study therapy, 531 once daily and 266 twice daily. At week 48, 472 (89%) of 531 once daily recipients and 235 (88%) of 266 twice daily recipients achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 40 copies per mL (treatment difference 0·5%, 95% CI −4·2 to 5·2). Drug-related adverse events occurred in 130 (24%) of 531 participants in the once daily group (one of which was serious; none led to treatment discontinuation) and 68 (26%) of 266 participants in the twice daily group (two of which were serious; two led to treatment discontinuation). The most common drug-related adverse events were nausea (39 [7%] vs 18 [7%]), headache (16 [3%] vs 12 [5%]), and dizziness (12 [2%] vs eight [3%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported.

However, the role of estrogen deprivation on adverse cardiac remodeling in nonobese T2DM rats has not been clearly elucidated. We hypothesized that estrogen-deprivation aggravates adverse cardiac remodeling in Goto–Kakizaki (GK) rats. Wild-type (WT) and GK rats at the age of 9 months old were divided into two subgroups to have either a sham operation (WTS, GKS) or a bilateral ovariectomy (WTO, GKO) (n = 6/subgroup). Four months after the operation, the rats were killed, and the heart was excised rapidly. Metabolic parameters, cardiomyocytes hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and biochemical parameters were determined. GK rats had hyperglycemia with hypoinsulinemia, and estrogen deprivation did not increase the severity of T2DM. Cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac oxidative stress, and phosphor-antinuclear factor ?B were higher in WTO and GKS rats than WTS rats, and they markedly increased in GKO rats compared with GKS rats. Furthermore, cardiac fibrosis, transforming growth factor-?, Bax, phosphor-p38, and peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor ? coactivator-1? expression were increased in GKS and GKO rats compared with the lean rats. However, mitochondrial dynamics proteins including dynamin-related protein 1 and mitofusin-2 were not altered by T2DM and estrogen deprivation. Although estrogen deprivation did not aggravate T2DM in GK rats, it increased the severity of cardiac hypertrophy by provoking cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress in nonobese GK rats. © 2017 The Author(s).",,antinuclear antibody; dynamin related protein 1; estrogen; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitochondrial protein; mitofusin 2; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; protein Bax; synaptophysin; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biochemical composition; cardiac muscle cell; carditis; chemical parameters; controlled study; disease exacerbation; disease severity; Goto Kakizaki rat; heart muscle fibrosis; heart ventricle hypertrophy; hyperglycemia; hypoinsulinemia; metabolic parameters; mitochondrial dynamics; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; ovariectomy; oxidative stress; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; rat; sham procedure,Article

The first dengue vaccine has already been licensed in six countries. Given the growing interests in the effective use of the vaccine, it is critical to understand the economic burden of dengue fever to guide decision-makers in setting health policy priorities. Methods/Principal findings: A standardized cost-of-illness study was conducted in three dengue endemic countries: Vietnam, Thailand, and Colombia. In order to capture all costs during the entire period of illness, patients were tested with rapid diagnostic tests on the first day of their clinical visits, and multiple interviews were scheduled until the patients recovered from the current illness. Various cost items were collected such as direct medical and non-medical costs, indirect costs, and non-out-of-pocket costs. In addition, socio-economic factors affecting disease severity were also identified by adopting a logit model. We found that total cost per episode ranges from $141 to $385 for inpatient and from $40 to $158 outpatient, with Colombia having the highest and Thailand having the lowest. The percentage of the private economic burden of dengue fever was highest in the low-income group and lowest in the high-income group. The logit analyses showed that early treatment, higher education, and better knowledge of dengue disease would reduce the probability of developing more severe illness. Conclusions/Significance: The cost of dengue fever is substantial in the three dengue endemic countries. Our study findings can be used to consider accelerated introduction of vaccines into the public and private sector programs and prioritize alternative health interventions among competing health problems. In addition, a community would be better off by propagating the socio-economic factors identified in this study, which may prevent its members from developing severe illness in the long run. © 2017 Lee et al.",,dengue vaccine; adolescent; adult; Article; attitude to health; caregiver; cost of illness; dengue; disease duration; disease severity; economic aspect; educational status; female; geographic distribution; health care cost; health care facility; highest income group; human; lowest income group; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; middle income country; perception; questionnaire; vector control; young adult; Colombia; dengue; economics; income; public health; Thailand; Viet Nam; Adolescent; Adult; Colombia; Cost of Illness; Dengue; Female; Humans; Income; Male; Public Health; Thailand; Vietnam; Young Adult,Article

Recent investigations have implicated neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the host response to tuberculosis. The aim of the current study was to obtain evidence for NETs release in the circulation during human tuberculosis. For this we measured the plasma concentrations of nucleosomes in conjunction with neutrophil elastase, in 64 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and 32 healthy controls. Patients with active tuberculosis had elevated plasma levels of nucleosomes and elastase when compared with local healthy blood donors. Furthermore nucleosome and elastase levels showed a positive correlation. These findings provide the first evidence for the release of NETs in the circulation of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",,leukocyte elastase; adult; Bangladesh; circulation; controlled study; enzyme blood level; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; extracellular trap; female; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immune response; Letter; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nucleosome; polymerase chain reaction,Letter

This method was improved from the previous laborious method for washing of red cell lysate preparation to develop whole blood EDTA lysate. In addition, the TPMT incubation was optimized and the chromatography was performed in a short runtime of 7 min on a C18-column by detection via triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The MS/MS was optimally tuned to monitor mass to charge a ratio (m/z) for 6-MMP 167.2 → 151.9 and the isotope 6-MMP-d3 with m/z of 170.5 → 152.2 were applied as an internal standard. The calibration curve covered the range of 2.5–360 ng/ml and the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.999. The accuracy of this method was determined in four concentrations of control of quality that ranged between 99.33 and 106.33%. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 4.41% and the inter-assay was less than 5.43%. This method developed for measuring TPMT by LC–MS/MS is a reliable, safe, and simple with a small volume requirement (100 μl of whole blood EDTA). The assay was used to study TPMT activity in 132 Thai children with a range from 29.0 to 89.1 nmol 6-MMP/g Hb/h with means and median values of TPMT activity 55.9 ± 12.47 nmol 6-MMP/g Hb/h and 54.2 nmol 6-MMP/g Hb/h.

There is currently no effective cure for the majority of neurodegenerative diseases and disease-affected tissues from patients have been difficult to obtain for research and drug discovery in pre-clinical settings. While the use of animal models has contributed invaluable mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic targets, the translational value of animal models could be further enhanced when combined with in vitro models derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and isogenic controls generated using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing. The iPSCs are self-renewable and capable of being differentiated into the cell types affected by the diseases. These in vitro models based on patient-derived iPSCs provide the opportunity to model disease development, uncover novel mechanisms and test potential therapeutics. Here we review findings from iPSC-based modeling of selected neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and spinocerebellar ataxia. Furthermore, we discuss the possibilities of generating three-dimensional (3D) models using the iPSCs-derived cells and compare their advantages and disadvantages to conventional two-dimensional (2D) models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2D neural cultures; 3D neural cultures; Alzheimer's disease; Ataxia; Disease models; Frontotemporal dementia; IPSC; Neurodegeneration,Animals; Cells; Cytology; Stem cells; Alzheimer's disease; Ataxia; Disease models; Frontotemporal dementias; IPSC; Neural cultures; Neurodegeneration; Neurodegenerative diseases; Alzheimer disease; cell differentiation; CRISPR-CAS9 system; degenerative disease; Down syndrome; frontotemporal dementia; gene editing; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; nerve cell culture; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; spinocerebellar degeneration; stem cell self-renewal; three dimensional imaging,Review

The success of MDA largely depends upon the efficacy of the anti-malarial drug regimen, local malaria epidemiology and the population coverage. In order to explore the reasons for participation in TME, a quantitative survey was conducted after the completion of the three rounds of MDA. Methods: The survey was conducted in two villages with a total of 158 households in July and August 2016. Among the 973 villagers eligible for participation in the MDA, 158 (16.2%) adults (> 18 years) were selected, one each from every household for the interviews using a quantitative questionnaire. Results: 150/158 (94.9%) respondents participated at least in one activity (taking medicine or testing their blood) of TME. 141/150 (94.0%) respondents took part in the MDA and tested their blood in all three rounds. 17/158 (10.7%) were partial or non-participants in three rounds of MDA. Characteristics of respondents which were independently associated with completion of three rounds of MDA included: attending TME meetings [AOR = 12.0 (95% CI 1.1-20.5) (p = 0.03)], knowing that malaria can be diagnosed through blood tests [AOR = 5.6 (95% CI 1.0-32.3) (p = 0.05)], all members from household participated [AOR = 4.2 (95% CI 1.3-14.0) (p = 0.02)], liking all aspects of TME [AOR = 17.2 (95% CI 1.6-177.9) (p = 0.02)] and the perception that TME was important [AOR = 14.9 (95% CI 1.3-171.2) (p = 0.03)]. Conclusion: Complete participation in TME was significantly associated with participation in community engagement activities, knowledge that the blood tests were for malaria diagnosis, family members' participation at TME and perceptions that TME was worthwhile. A responsive approach to community engagement that includes formative research and the involvement of community members may increase the uptake of the intervention. © 2017 The Author(s).",Acceptability; Community; Elimination; Engagement; Knowledge; Malaria; Trust,piperaquine; primaquine; adult; Article; blood examination; controlled study; directly observed therapy; female; human; interview; Laos; low drug dose; major clinical study; malaria; malaria control; male; patient attitude; patient participation; questionnaire; single drug dose; targeted malaria elimination,Article

METHODS All patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma between 2008 and 2013 were identified using the Nationwide Hospital Admission Data registry (n = 39421). Baseline characteristics, comorbidities and survival were abstracted. RESULTS The annual incidence during the study period was stable in all regions. Most patients lived in the Northeast (62.8%), followed by the North (16.9%), Central (12.3%), Bangkok (5.4%), and South (n = 2.6%) regions (p < 0.0001). Significantly more cholangiocarcinoma patients had diabetes, cirrhosis, and chronic viral hepatitis B/C infection than noncholangiocarcinoma participants (diabetes: 11.42% vs 5.28%; cirrhosis: 4.81% vs 0.92%; hepatitis B: 0.74% vs 0.12%; and hepatitis C: 0.50% vs 0.10%, p < 0.0001 for all, respectively). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 81.7%, with a stable trend over time.

Case series: Case 1: A 61-year-old man was brought in nine hours after drinking 400–500 mL of Tako-Na tea. One handful of Tako-Na bark was boiled in water to make tea. He had vomiting and watery diarrhea six hours after drinking it. He took no medications and had no history of hypertension. The only remarkable vital sign was BP 167/90 mmHg. Physical examination revealed generalized muscle weakness. Laboratory findings were potassium 2.7 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, and transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) 5.6. He was discharged the next day with a BP 140/90 mmHg and potassium 4.2 mmol/L. Case 2: A 78-year-old man, a friend of case 1, also drank Tako-Na tea from the same pot at the same time as case 1. He also had vomiting and diarrhea six hours later. He took no medications despite past history of hypertension (baseline SBP 140–160). Initial BP was 230/70 mmHg. He also had muscle weakness. Laboratory findings were potassium 3.3 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, TTKG 7.37 and normal thyroid function. He was also discharged the next day with a BP 148/70 mmHg and potassium 4.2 mmol/L. Case 3–7: These were patients reported to a poison center and their potassium concentrations were 1.4, 1.4, 3.3, 1.3 and 1.2 mmol/L, respectively. Three of them were intubated and case 3 died. Conclusions: Tako-Na contains betulin, betulinic acid, taraxerone, lupeol, and lupenone. Their structures are similar to glycyrrhetic acid, the active metabolite of glycyrrhizic acid found in licorice which is well known to cause pseudoaldosteronism. Glycyrrhetic acid is potent in inhibiting 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and causes pseudoaldosteronism. We hypothesize that the compounds in Tako-Na act in the same way as glycyrrhetic acid in producing pseudoaldosteronism. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",beta-sitosterol; betulin; betulinic acid; herbal remedy; licorice; lupenone; lupeol; mineralocorticoid; Pseudoaldosteronism; taraxerone,"calcium channel blocking agent; herbaceous agent; potassium; biological marker; plant medicinal product; potassium; acute diarrhea; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; Article; bark; bloating; case report; clinical article; cohort analysis; Diospyros; Diospyros rhodocalyx; dyspnea; electrocardiogram; endotracheal intubation; female; health promotion; heart arrest; heart ventricle bigeminy; herbal tea; hospital discharge; human; hypertension; hypokalemia; knee pain; length of stay; male; middle aged; muscle weakness; nausea; paralysis; paresthesia; physical examination; poison center; potassium blood level; retrospective study; Thailand; traditional medicine; Verner Morrison syndrome; vomiting; adverse effects; blood; blood pressure; chemically induced; Diospyros; drug effects; electrocardiography; heart rate; heart ventricle extrasystole; hypertension; hypokalemia; Liddle syndrome; medicinal plant; muscle strength; muscle weakness; pathophysiology; phytotherapy; skeletal muscle; traditional medicine; Aged; Biomarkers; Blood Pressure; Diospyros; Electrocardiography; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypertension; Hypokalemia; Liddle Syndrome; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Muscle Weakness; Muscle, Skeletal; Phytotherapy; Plant Preparations; Plants, Medicinal; Potassium; Retrospective Studies; Thailand; Ventricular Premature Complexes",Article

Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are possible theoretical candidates for DM. Hypothetically, WIMPs can be detected indirectly by their annihilation or decay products. A possible product is a γ ray. Many DM profile models predict a higher density of WIMPs near the Galactic center. Here we search for monochromatic γ-ray emission from the Galactic center region in data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the main instrument onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.

Coating hydrophobic layer on alumina surface can help prolonging its lifetime. In this study, 25 ×25 mm alumina sheets were used as substrates. The hydrophobic composite polymers were prepared from (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane(MPTMS), 2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-2,4,6,8tetravinylcyclotetra siloxane(TMTVSi), pentaerythritoltetra(3-mercaptopropionate)(PETMP), 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phe nylaceto phenone(photoinitiator) and heptadecafluorodecylmethacrylate(HEFDMA) via the thiol-ene reaction. The alumina sheets were first activated by dielectric-barrier discharge plasma to improve its adhesion. All the polymers were found to optimize at the ratio of (MPTMS:TMTVSi:PETMP:HDFDMA) to 4:2:1:2 for coating on the alumina substrate. To enhance polymerization, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylaceto phenome was also used as a photoinitiator A proper mixing sequence in the thiol-ene reaction results in film with excellent surface retention after prolong soaking in solvent such as acetone. FTIR shows that S-H and C=C functional groups have significantly changed after photopolymerization and thermally cured. The static contact angle increase from mere 53.0°±1.5° of the uncoated substrate to 120.0°±1.2° after coating. SEM shows the film with clear appearance of a few-micron thick. Under AFM, the coated surface roughness was about 9.3 nm with evenly distributed spikes of a few nanometer in height. The cross-cut test also confirmed the film was very smooth and none of the square of the films detached. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Acetone; Alumina; Coatings; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Hydrophobicity; Photopolymerization; Plasma applications; Plasma polymerization; Plastic coatings; Polymerization; Substrates; Surface roughness; Thallium compounds; 3-mercaptopropionate; Alumina substrates; Dielectric barrier discharge plasmas; Electrical insulators; Hydrophobic layers; Plasma activation; Static contact angle; Thiol-ene reactions; Activated alumina,Conference Paper

In this work, the polyacrylic acid is formed by using the emulsion disturbance method. Despite extensively used in the colour painting and coating industries, acrylic emulsion can be processed into a foam and powder configuration by a reaction between acrylic emulsion and salt. The solidification hardly changes the volume between liquid emulsion and solidified polymer which means the final structure of polyacrylic acid is filled with opened air cells. The opened air cell structure is confirmed by the result from scanning electron microscopy. The chemical analysis and crystallography of acrylic powder and foam are examined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction respectively. The phase transformation and Thermal stability are studied by differential scanning calorimetry and thermo gravimetric analysis. Moreover, the mechanical properties of acrylic foam were observed by tensile, compressive and hardness test.

In this work, the wavelet analysis of cyclic waveform was investigated in order to find the distinguishable feature from the cyclic data. The analyzed wavelet coefficients were proposed to be used as selected cyclic feature parameters. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of different electrodes consisting of carbon nanotube (CNT) and several types of metal phthalocyanine (MPc) including CoPc, FePc, ZnPc and MnPc powders was used as several sets of cyclic data for various types of coffee. The mixture powder was embedded in a hollow Teflon rod and used as working electrodes. Electrochemical response of the fabricated electrodes in Robusta, blend coffee I, blend coffee II, chocolate malt and cocoa at the same concentrations was measured with scanning rate of 0.05V/s from -1.5 to 1.5V respectively to Ag/AgCl electrode for five scanning loops. The CV of blended CNT electrode with some MPc electrodes indicated the ionic interaction which can be the effect of catalytic oxidation of saccharides and/or polyphenol on the sensor surface. The major information of CV response can be extracted by using several mother wavelet families viz. daubechies (dB1 to dB3), coiflets (coiflet1), biorthogonal (Bior1.1) and symlets (sym2) and then the discrimination of these wavelet coefficients of each data group can be separated by principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA results indicated the clearly separate groups with total contribution more than 62.37% representing from PC1 and PC2. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Catalytic oxidation; Chlorine compounds; Cyclic voltammetry; Data handling; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Powder metals; Silver compounds; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Yarn; Ag/AgCl electrodes; Cyclic voltammograms; Electrochemical response; Feature parameters; Ionic interaction; Metalphthalocyanines; Wavelet coefficients; Working electrode; Principal component analysis,Conference Paper

The results showed that a number of students produce errors and revealed alternative conceptions especially when asked to draw graphical form of vector components. It indicated that most of them did not develop a strong foundation of understanding in vector components and could not apply those concepts to such problems with physical context. Based on the findings, we designed a worksheet to enhance the students' conceptual understanding in vector components. The worksheet is composed of three parts which help students to construct their own understanding of definition, graphical form, and magnitude of vector components. To validate the worksheet, focus group discussions of 3 and 10 graduate students (science in-service teachers) had been conducted. The modified worksheet was then distributed to 41 grade 9 students in a science class. The students spent approximately 50 minutes to complete the worksheet. They sketched and measured vectors and its components and compared with the trigonometry ratio to condense the concepts of vector components. After completing the worksheet, their conceptual model had been verified. 83% of them constructed the correct model of vector components. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Education; Education computing; Teaching; Vectors; Alternative conception; Conceptual understanding; Graduate students; Open-ended problems; Physics education; Research instruments; Undergraduate students; Vector components; Students,Conference Paper

It can potentially be used as a chemical catalyst, and gas sensing material. There are methods to fabricate CuFeO2 such as chemical synthesis, sintering, sputtering, and chemical vapor deposition. In our work, CuFeO2 is prepared by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing. The composite filament which composed of Cu and Fe elements is printed in three dimensions, and then sintered and annealed at high temperature to obtain CuFeO2. Suitable polymer blend and maximum percent volume of metal powder are studied. When percent volume of metal powder is increased, melt flow rate of polymer blend is also increased. The most suitable printing condition is reported and the properties of CuFeO2 are observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Dynamic Scanning Calorimeter, X-ray diffraction. As a new method to produce semiconductor, this technique has a potential to allow any scientist or students to design and print a catalyst or sensing material by the most conventional 3D printing machine which is commonly used around the world. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Blending; Catalysts; Chemical vapor deposition; Copper compounds; Deposition; Gas sensing electrodes; Iron compounds; Layered manufacturing; Metals; Oxide minerals; Polymer blends; Powder metals; Printing; Scanning electron microscopy; Sintering; Vapor deposition; X ray diffraction; Chemical catalyst; Dynamic scanning; Fused deposition modeling; Gas sensing material; Mineral materials; Printing conditions; Sensing material; Three dimensions; 3D printers,Conference Paper

When people suffer from stress repeatedly, stress will turn to be multiple physical conditions and psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. iCare-stress application was created to assist a person to know his/her own state of stress and handle properly using the user's brainwave detected by Emotiv device. In addition, the application provides an interesting technique called Neurofeedback which is used to train human brain activity. Neurofeedback is widely accepted in medicinal studies to reduce the symptoms of many diseases. Therefore, it is chosen to be the technique to manage and reduce stress in the application. Moreover, there are three interventions for doing the different activities such as Concentration, Relaxation, and Music Therapy. In the case of measuring stress without the device, the application provides a set of questionnaire which is called General Health Questionnaire or GHQ that a user can apply to check his/her stress level.

However, to read news articles online, users may have faced problems. For example, they are bombarded with articles which are not related to their interest. From this problem, it would be better if users can manage their preferences to perceive news. Therefore, Newsaday is proposed and prototyped to mitigate such issues.

Two main problems are that they cannot remember the vocabularies and they cannot use the suitable words to form the sentences. In order to response to these problems, the proposed mobile application, called Woocabulary, has been developed to support learners to memorize the vocabularies, to understand the meaning of the words, and to correctly construct the English sentences. The innovation of the project is that the proposed mechanism has formulated the relationship (called word association) between the words and formed the words’ structure indicating the words’ sequences supporting learners to perform the learning activities.

Then, the developers believe that playing game is a part which can help for better learning. “Pelement” is a periodic table game in kind of match-three puzzle game that helps players to learn and remember the important elements. This game has several different levels which allow players to match elements followed by groups of elements within the limited moves to pass each level. Also, there is a quiz about the elements for players to learn. For the analysis result, players are most satisfied with Pelement game in terms of entertainment 57 percent and learning 58 percent. © 2017 IEEE.",Elements; Periodic table; Puzzle game,Chemical elements; Chemical properties; P-elements; Periodic table; Puzzle games; Systematic thinkings; Students,Conference Paper

They do not know how often and when the best time to measure blood pressure. In order to guide senior citizens with hypertension to take care of themselves, oHealth, a self-care android application, was proposed. By using oHealth application connected with blood pressure device, senior citizens can measure and monitor their blood pressure daily at home anytime. In each day, they can also record about medicines and food intake and exercise for treatment. All records are kept in azure SQL database. Moreover, this application also provides user interface design that is suit for senior citizens. oHealth application has six main functions which are manage profile, measure blood pressure, provide knowledge, record treatment, provide reminders, and perform data analysis by using multiclass logistic regression method in azure machine learning. The ultimate goal of oHealth application is to assist senior citizens to prevent, evaluate, and treat hypertension, and to help them control medicine, food, and exercise to treat hypertension in an appropriate way. © 2017 IEEE.",Android application; Azure machine learning; Blood pressure device; Hypertension; Senior citizens,Artificial intelligence; Blood pressure; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Technology transfer; User interfaces; Android applications; Food intake; Hypertension; Multi-class logistic regressions; Pressure devices; Senior citizens; SQL database; User interface designs; Android (operating system),Conference Paper

Typical imaging interpretations are done by a board certified physician, called radiologist. When other physicians have questions on a given imaging report, they need to consult a radiologist for better understanding of a medical case. These physicians are not locate in the same location. They have to spend time moving from one location to another location to seek for a consultation from a radiology about images in question. It is a very time consuming process and inefficient use of resources. This project offers an app called “REMOTIMAGE” that offers an easy access to view medical images on smartphone and ordering medical images to be displayed on remote devices by using wireless and network programming technology. A time required for this method is just a few minutes as compare to ten of minutes or more. The application is developed by using JavaScript along with Ionic framework deployed on both Android and iOS devices. This app provides faster access to a patient’s medical images by obtaining a patient accession number from a barcode.

Patients requiring long term treatment and who are admitted at an in-patient department (IPD) are at risk of pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcers can interfere with patient health recovery, resulting in increased cost of treatment and prolongation of hospital stay. Three factors contributing to pressure ulcers are mobility impairment, nutritional impairment, and skin health impairment. This paper presents a system that can remind IPD nurses to perform a repositioning activity to a patient with mobility impairment according to standard clinical practice guideline (CPG). This helps to relieve interface pressure on patient skin and prevent incidents of pressure ulcers. The system uses Xbee over IEEE 802.15.4 for Point-To-Multipoint wireless communication. The system is designed for easy setup and low-power consumption. The system provides a graphic interfere for non-Technical staff such as nurses to set up and monitor multiple devices installed at patient beds from an IPD nursing center. A prototype was built and tested in an IPD ward of a general public hospital in Thailand. The experiment was designed to ensure that all requirements were fulfilled and ensure CPG of patient repositioning. © 2017 IEEE.",Nursing care; Pressure ulcer prevention; Xbee wireless communication,Diseases; Hospitals; Nursing; Patient rehabilitation; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Clinical practice guidelines; Low-power consumption; Non-technical staff; Nursing care; Patient repositioning; Point to multipoint; Pressure ulcer preventions; Wireless communications; Patient treatment,Conference Paper

With many failed attempts to establish MOOCs in Thailand, doubts often arise whether MOOCs would be the right platform that would mitigate the problems of the existing educational system in such a nation. In this paper, we first provide the history of MOOCs in Thailand. Then we discuss some of the major challenges that prevent such an online learning platform to thrive in Thailand, compared to those offline classroom-based educational programs.

Redesigning business processes is an effective way for improvement. However, business process mapping and analysis in healthcare environment has become a complex task. Besides, most healthcare professionals often resist change. To deal with these obstacles, a design thinking framework and design patterns useful for modelling and simulation are proposed in this article. Initially, current problems focusing on hospital pharmacy management are identified through empirical investigation. According to the problems, the suitable solutions are determined based on the related literature. Afterwards, the holistic view of problems and their solutions with different aspects can be structured as the design thinking framework. For each solution, the design patterns are represented through various attributes including pattern name, purpose, description, modelling structure using a business process modelling notation. Likewise, the attributes facilitated to simulation modelling are also combined such as control variables and performance measures. Here, based on the crucial problem that mostly concerned in any hospital case studies, the design pattern related to the problem of inefficient inventory management policy is illustrated and verified. Through a design thinking framework and design patterns, business users or process modellers can rapidly understand the context of problems and conduct a successful simulation study. It can be a valuable tool to redesign healthcare systems. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group",BPMN; business process redesign; design pattern; Design thinking framework; hospital pharmacy management; modelling; simulation,controlled study; health care system; hospital pharmacy; human; human experiment; process model; thinking,Article in Press

Literature was systematically searched in Medline, Scopus and Cochrane databases from inception to July 2017. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English were selected if they had any pair of interventions (calcium, vitamin D, both, or placebo). Systematic review with two-step network-meta-analysis was used to indirectly estimate supplementary effects. Twenty-seven RCTs with 28,000 women were eligible. A direct meta-analysis suggested that calcium, vitamin D, and calcium plus vitamin D could lower risk of preeclampsia when compared to placebo with the pooled risk ratios (RRs) of 0.54 (0.41, 0.70), 0.47 (0.24, 0.89) and 0.50 (0.32, 0.78), respectively. Results of network meta-analysis were similar with the corresponding RRs of 0.49 (0.35, 0.69), 0.43 (0.17, 1.11), and 0.57 (0.30, 1.10), respectively. None of the controls were significant. Efficacy of supplementation, which was ranked by surface under cumulative ranking probabilities, were: vitamin D (47.4%), calcium (31.6%) and calcium plus vitamin D (19.6%), respectively. Calcium supplementation may be used for prevention for preeclampsia. Vitamin D might also worked well but further large scale RCTs are warranted to confirm our findings. © 2017 by the authors.

We found that clonotypes expressing the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) β-chain variable region 11 (TRBV11-2) were 'preferentially' activated and mobilized within immunodominant human-leukocyte-antigen-(HLA)-A∗11:01-restricted CD8 + T cell populations specific for variants of the nonstructural protein epitope NS3 133 that characterize the serotypes DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4. In contrast, the NS3 133 -DENV2-specific repertoire was largely devoid of such TCRs. Structural analysis of a representative TRBV11-2 + TCR demonstrated that cross-serotype reactivity was governed by unique interplay between the variable antigenic determinant and germline-encoded residues in the second β-chain complementarity-determining region (CDR2β). Extensive mutagenesis studies of three distinct TRBV11-2 + TCRs further confirmed that antigen recognition was dependent on key contacts between the serotype-defined peptide and discrete residues in the CDR2β loop. Collectively, these data reveal an innate-like mode of epitope recognition with potential implications for the outcome of sequential exposure to heterologous DENVs. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

Although some cross-reactive dengue virus (DENV)-specific antibodies can enhance ZIKV infection in mice, those recognizing the DENV E-dimer epitope (EDE) can neutralize ZIKV infection in cell culture. We evaluated the therapeutic activity of human monoclonal antibodies to DENV EDE for their ability to control ZIKV infection in the brains, testes, placentas, and fetuses of mice. A single dose of the EDE1-B10 antibody given 3 d after ZIKV infection protected against lethality, reduced ZIKV levels in brains and testes, and preserved sperm counts. In pregnant mice, wild-type or engineered LALA variants of EDE1-B10, which cannot engage Fcg receptors, diminished ZIKV burden in maternal and fetal tissues, and protected against fetal demise. Because neutralizing antibodies to EDE have therapeutic potential against ZIKV, in addition to their established inhibitory effects against DENV, it may be possible to develop therapies that control disease caused by both viruses. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

Ayhan, B., Hacettepe University, Intensive Care Unit, Ankara, Turkey","Background: Mildly elevated lactate levels (i.e., 1-2 mmol/L) are increasingly recognized as a prognostic finding in critically ill patients. One of several possible underlying mechanisms, microcirculatory dysfunction, can be assessed at the bedside using sublingual direct in vivo microscopy. We aimed to evaluate the association between relative hyperlactatemia, microcirculatory flow, and outcome. Methods: This study was a predefined subanalysis of a multicenter international point prevalence study on microcirculatory flow abnormalities, the Microcirculatory Shock Occurrence in Acutely ill Patients (microSOAP). Microcirculatory flow abnormalities were assessed with sidestream dark-field imaging. Abnormal microcirculatory flow was defined as a microvascular flow index (MFI) < 2.6. MFI is a semiquantitative score ranging from 0 (no flow) to 3 (continuous flow). Associations between microcirculatory flow abnormalities, single-spot lactate measurements, and outcome were analyzed. Results: In 338 of 501 patients, lactate levels were available. For this substudy, all 257 patients with lactate levels ≤ 2 mmol/L (median [IQR] 1.04 [0.80-1.40] mmol/L) were included. Crude ICU mortality increased with each lactate quartile. In a multivariable analysis, a lactate level > 1.5 mmol/L was independently associated with a MFI < 2.6 (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.7, P = 0.027). Conclusions: In a heterogeneous ICU population, a single-spot mildly elevated lactate level (even within the reference range) was independently associated with increased mortality and microvascular flow abnormalities. In vivo microscopy of the microcirculation may be helpful in discriminating between flow- and non-flow-related causes of mildly elevated lactate levels.

Existing prognostic models cannot be applied without validation in LMICs as the different disease profiles, resource availability, and heterogeneity of the population may limit the transferability of such scores. A major shortcoming in using such models in LMICs is the unavailability of required measurements. This study proposes a simplified critical care prognostic model for use at the time of ICU admission. Methods: This was a prospective study of 3855 patients admitted to 21 ICUs from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka who were aged 16years and over and followed to ICU discharge. Variables captured included patient age, admission characteristics, clinical assessments, laboratory investigations, and treatment measures. Multivariate logistic regression was used to develop three models for ICU mortality prediction: model 1 with clinical, laboratory, and treatment variables; model 2 with clinical and laboratory variables; and model 3, a purely clinical model. Internal validation based on bootstrapping (1000 samples) was used to calculate discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow C-Statistic; higher values indicate poorer calibration). Comparison was made with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II models. Results: Model 1 recorded the respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), blood urea, haemoglobin, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor use on ICU admission. Model 2, named TropICS (Tropical Intensive Care Score), included emergency surgery, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, GCS, blood urea, and haemoglobin. Model 3 included respiratory rate, emergency surgery, and GCS. AUC was 0.818 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.800-0.835) for model 1, 0.767 (0.741-0.792) for TropICS, and 0.725 (0.688-0.762) for model 3. The Hosmer-Lemeshow C-Statistic p values were less than 0.05 for models 1 and 3 and 0.18 for TropICS. In comparison, when APACHE II and SAPS II were applied to the same dataset, AUC was 0.707 (0.688-0.726) and 0.714 (0.695-0.732) and the C-Statistic was 124.84 (p<0.001) and 1692.14 (p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion: This paper proposes TropICS as the first multinational critical care prognostic model developed in a non-HIC setting. © 2017 The Author(s).",APACHE II; Critical care; Lower middle income country; Model performance; Prognostic model; Resource limited settings,hemoglobin; hypertensive factor; urea; adolescent; adult; aged; APACHE; area under the curve; Article; artificial ventilation; Bangladesh; breathing rate; comparative study; controlled study; critically ill patient; drug use; emergency surgery; follow up; Glasgow coma scale; hemoglobin blood level; Hosmer Lemeshow C Statistic; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; India; intensive care unit; low income country; major clinical study; middle income country; mortality; Nepal; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; Simplified Acute Physiology Score; South Asia; Sri Lanka; statistical analysis; statistical model; systolic blood pressure; Tropical Intensive Care Score; urea blood level,Article

Understanding the genetic relationship of residual parasite populations can help track the origins of the parasites that are reintroduced into malaria-free regions within the country. Methodology/Results: A total of 127 P. vivax isolates were genotyped from two western provinces (Tak and Kanchanaburi) and one eastern province (Ubon Ratchathani) of Thailand using 10 microsatellite markers. Genetic diversity was high, but recent clonal expansion was detected in all three provinces. Substantial population structure and genetic differentiation of parasites among provinces suggest limited gene flow among these sites. There was no haplotype sharing among the three sites, and a reduced panel of four microsatellite markers was sufficient to assign the parasites to their provincial origins. Conclusion/Significance: Significant parasite genetic differentiation between provinces shows successful interruption of parasite spread within Thailand, but high diversity along international borders implies a substantial parasite population size in these regions. The provincial origin of P. vivax cases can be reliably determined by genotyping four microsatellite markers, which should be useful for monitoring parasite reintroduction after malaria elimination. © 2017 Kittichai et al.",,"Article; bottleneck population; disease transmission; DNA extraction; effective population size; gene flow; gene frequency; genetic distance; genetic variability; genotyping technique; haplotype; human; malaria control; microsatellite marker; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; polymerase chain reaction; population differentiation; population structure; Thailand; Cambodia; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; international cooperation; Malaria, Vivax; Myanmar; parasitology; phylogeography; physiology; Plasmodium vivax; transmission; microsatellite DNA; Cambodia; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Haplotypes; Humans; Internationality; Malaria, Vivax; Microsatellite Repeats; Myanmar; Phylogeography; Plasmodium vivax; Thailand",Article

However this renewable waste resource can be a good source of starch. This study is aimed to extract and characterize the starch using the common mechanical extraction with water. The physicochemical properties of pineapple stem starch have been investigated and compared with those of some commercial starches from rice, corn and cassava. Pineapple stem starch has unique and distinct properties when compared to the commercial starches. It has the highest amylose content (34.4%), gelatinization temperature (To = 82.8 °C), gelatinization enthalpy (19.4 J/g) and pasting temperature (90.6 °C). However under normal cooking condition, it has the lowest paste viscosity. These potentially beneficial characteristics make pineapple stem starch a good source of resistant and thermoplastic starch for food and non-food applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Alternative starch resource; Amylose content; Physicochemical properties; Pineapple stem starch; Starch extraction,Agricultural wastes; Cyclodextrins; Extraction; Gelation; Alternative starch resource; Amylose content; Gelatinization temperature; Mechanical extraction; Physicochemical property; Renewable waste resources; Starch extraction; Thermoplastic starch; Starch; biochemical composition; biogenic material; comparative study; extraction method; fruit; physicochemical property; plant extract; renewable resource; starch; stem; Thailand; Ananas comosus; Manihot esculenta; Zea mays,Article

The objectives of this research are to define significant sources of environmental impact throughout a large jewelry manufacturing value chain, and to understand the consequences of using materials from different sources in order to identify potential solutions towards green industry. Feasible solutions to environmental impact reduction regarding material sourcing, energy consumption and waste treatment are recommended based on the comparison of the results. An environmental assessment is conducted following a life cycle assessment framework provided in ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006. The assessment focuses on the impacts of environmental interventions from the value chain associated with the company operations in 2013. All in all one business-as-usual, ten alternative and nine sensitivity scenarios are developed to assess the impacts from the company's operations in 2013, to determine potential impact reductions from feasible solutions and to investigate the robustness of the results. The representative data for manufacturing stage were primarily gathered from the company while the data for other stages are secondary data. Gold and silver mining and refining is the largest contributor from the overall supply chain for all impact categories considered. Using recycled gold and silver is the most effective solution to decrease life cycle negative impacts. The use of gold and silver recycled from high-value industries (i.e. jewelry production) produces less adverse impacts compared to gold and silver recycled from end-of-life electronic waste. According to the statistical data, gold and silver mining and refining could be the suppliers capable of supplying gold and silver because of the market constraints of recycled gold and silver. Green mining operations are introduced as alternatives to reduce impact directly generated from mining operations. For manufacturing, electricity consumption reduction shows a potential impact reduction. Using recycled gold and silver is recommended for jewelry manufacturers who plan to reduce environmental impacts. Using gold and silver from green mining is also recommended when the use of gold and silver from mining is necessary. Reducing electricity consumption in manufacturing is also one option for the company since it could be activated directly. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Corporate environmental assessment; Gold and silver mining; Jewelry manufacturing; Life cycle assessment; Precious metal recycling,Data reduction; Electric power utilization; Electronic Waste; Energy utilization; Gold; Industrial research; Life cycle; Manufacture; Precious metals; Recycling; Refining; Silver; Silver refining; Supply chains; Waste treatment; Electricity-consumption; End-of-life electronics; Environmental assessment; Gold and silver; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Manufacturing stages; Metal recycling; Precious metal industry; Environmental impact,Article

An addition of secondary solid complex triglycerides (Softisan 378; S378) into solid wax (cetyl palmitate; CP) is expected to influence the properties of obtained SLN compared to SLN prepared from sole CP. Experiments Ibuprofen-loaded SLN (IBSLN-TG) composed of different ratios of CP and S378 were prepared and evaluated in term of size, zeta potential (ZP), entrapment efficiency (E.E.), crystallinity, lipid-drug interaction and in vitro drug release. Findings After production, all developed IBSLN-TG prepared from different ratios of CP and S378 had the particle size in the nanometer range (180–200 nm) with the ZP values of higher than |−40 mV| and possessed approximately 100% E.E. The release of IBSLN-TG demonstrated the biphasic pattern with a fast release followed by sustained release, which was fitted to Higuchi's kinetics. The addition of S378 into CP-matrix led to a slight decrease in particle size and surface charge, and distortion of CP crystallization. The results from 1H-NMR indicated the formation of tiny liquid S378 nanocompartments within CP-matrix. The localization of ibuprofen in the S378 nanocompartments and the interaction between ibuprofen and S378 had an impact on the release profiles of IBSLN-TG depending on the ratios of CP and S378. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Binary solid lipid matrix; Crystallinity; Dermal delivery; Solid lipid nanoparticles; Supercooled melts; Sustained release,Bins; Drug products; Nanoparticles; Palmitic acid; Particle size; Crystallinities; Dermal delivery; Lipid matrix; Solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN); Supercooled melt; Sustained release; Drug interactions; ibuprofen; solid lipid nanoparticle; triacylglycerol; Article; drug release; in vitro study; lipid composition; nanoemulsion; particle size; physical chemistry; priority journal; static electricity; stereospecificity; surface charge; sustained drug release; transdermal drug delivery system; viscometry; zeta potential,Article

LF is caused by filarial nematode parasites, i.e. Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and B. timori. All available antifilarial drugs currently being used have shown a limited adulticidal activity. Discoveries of endosymbiont rickettsia-like bacterium, Wolbachia in filarial nematodes provided a novel approach for antibiotic use in eradication of filarial diseases. The earlier studies revealed the macrofilaricidal efficacy of doxycycline against filarial nematodes. Chemotherapeutic efficiency of doxycycline has been studied against many filarial parasites, but there are still no therapeutic trials of the drug regimens for B. malayi treatment in naturally infected cats. Thus, this study would be the first attempt to study the efficiency of doxycycline (DOXY) alone or in combination with ivermectin (IVM) for treatment of B. malayi in naturally infected cats. A total of 26 B. malayi-infected cats in the endemic areas were recruited and divided into 3 groups, receiving different treatment regimens; a single dose of ivermectin only (IVM), doxycycline only (DOXY) and a combination of ivermectin and doxycycline (DOXY-IVM). The efficacy of each therapatic regimen was evaluated by detecting the presence of microfilaria using parasitological and molecular techniques monthly up to 2 years after starting the treatment. The IVM treated group had a significant rapid reduction of microfilariae in the first month; however, recurrence of microfilaraemia was observed in some cats. By contrast, the DOXY and DOXY-IVM groups showed a better result with a gradual decrease in microfilariae with no recurrence. These 2 groups were not only virtually deprived of infection but also sustained the sterility of infection through the course of study. These results revealed the advantages of using in B. malayi treatment in cats. Doxycycline showed to have both microfilaricidal and adulticidal effects on lymphatic filariae which maintained the long-term response to control of B. malayi infection in cats. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Brugia malayi; Doxycycline; Ivermectin; Lymphatic filariasis,"doxycycline; ivermectin; animal; Brugia malayi; cat; cat disease; combination drug therapy; filariasis; parasitology; veterinary; Animals; Brugia malayi; Cat Diseases; Cats; Doxycycline; Drug Therapy, Combination; Filariasis; Ivermectin",Article

X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis results of the films were obtained and used to explain the mechanical property data. Combined use of glycerol, NaCl and homogenization led to increased zeta potential but decreased viscosity of the solution. Electrostatic repulsion led to extended chitosan chains and lower film crystallinity and glass transition temperature due to weaker hydrogen bonding and increased amide-I band interactions.

Low nucleotide and haplotype diversity similar to G6 strains from Russia (Altai republic) and Kazakhstan was also found, consistent with a bottleneck effect. In this study, G6 was the most common Echinococcus genotype.

The testing protocols are relatively simple, requiring a certain amount of a specific antibody to detect its corresponding pathogen. Antibody functionality can be mimicked by synthesizing molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), i.e. polymers that can selectively recognize a given template structure. Thus, MIPs are sometimes termed ‘plastic antibody (PA)’. In this study, we have synthesized new granular MIPs using influenza A virus templates by precipitation polymerization. The selective binding of influenza A to the MIP particles was assessed and subsequently contrasted with other viruses. The affinities of influenza A virus towards the MIP was estimated based on an agglutination test by measuring the amount of influenza subtypes absorbed onto the MIPs.

Seven co-crystal structures with P. vivax (Pv) SHMT were solved at 2.2–2.6 Å resolution. We observed an unprecedented influence of the torsion angle of ortho-substituted biphenyl moieties on cell-based efficacy. The peculiar lipophilic character of the sulfonyl moiety was highlighted in the complexes with aryl sulfonamide analogues, which bind in their preferred staggered orientation. The results are discussed within the context of conformational preferences in the ligands. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We identified and reviewed the records of patients who had been diagnosed with CCC and for whom sufficient tumor samples for DNA and RNA extraction were available in our database. The specimens were explored for EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations and ROS1 translocation in 81 samples. Immunohistochemistry staining for HER2, ALK, and Ki-67 expression was tested in 74 samples. Prevalence of EGFR, KRAS, and PIK3CA mutations in this study was 21%, 12%, and 16%, respectively. No BRAF V600 mutation or ROS1 translocation was found. Patients with T790M mutation had a significantly longer overall survival (18.84 months) than those with the other types of EGFR mutations (4.08 months; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.26, P=0.038) and also had a significantly lower median Ki-67 (22.5% vs 80%, P=0.025). Furthermore, patients with PIK3CA mutations had a significantly longer median progression-free survival (15.87 vs 7.01 months; HR: 0.46, P=0.043). Strongly positive HER2 expression was found in only 1 patient, whereas ALK expression was not found. The presence of EGFR and/or PIK3CA mutations implies that targeted drugs may provide a feasible CCC treatment in the future. © 2017 Trachu et al.",Cholangiocarcinoma; Gene alterations; Targeted therapy,"activin receptor like kinase 1; B Raf kinase; CA 19-9 antigen; capecitabine; carcinoembryonic antigen; cisplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; fluorouracil; folinic acid; gemcitabine; hepatitis B surface antigen; K ras protein; Ki 67 antigen; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase catalytic subunit alpha; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Article; Asian; backache; bile duct carcinoma; biliary tract cancer; BRAF gene; cancer genetics; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; Caucasian; controlled study; droplet digital polymerase chain reaction; dyspnea; EGFR gene; exon; female; gastrointestinal disease; gene amplification; gene frequency; gene mutation; gene rearrangement; gene translocation; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; oncogene; oncogene B raf; oncogene K ras; Opisthorchis viverrini; overall survival; PIK3CA gene; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; progression free survival; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; ROS1 gene; Sanger sequencing; survival time; symptom; Tai people; Thailand; weight reduction",Article

The development of an efficacious vaccine would contribute greatly to control malaria. Recently, using bacterial and adenoviral recombinant proteins based on the P. vivax circumsporozoite protein (CSP), we demonstrated the possibility of eliciting strong antibody-mediated immune responses to each of the three allelic forms of P. vivax CSP (PvCSP). In the present study, recombinant proteins representing the PvCSP alleles (VK210, VK247, and P. vivax-like), as well as a hybrid polypeptide, named PvCSP-All epitopes, were generated. This hybrid containing the conserved C-terminal of the PvCSP and the three variant repeat domains in tandem were successfully produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris. After purification and biochemical characterization, they were used for the experimental immunization of C57BL/6 mice in a vaccine formulation containing the adjuvant Poly(I:C). Immunization with a recombinant protein expressing all three different allelic forms in fusion elicited high IgG antibody titers reacting with all three different allelic variants of PvCSP. The antibodies targeted both the C-terminal and repeat domains of PvCSP and recognized the native protein on the surface of P. vivax sporozoites. More importantly, mice that received the vaccine formulation were protected after challenge with chimeric Plasmodium berghei sporozoites expressing CSP repeats of P. vivax sporozoites (Pb/PvVK210). Our results suggest that it is possible to elicit protective immunity against one of the most common PvCSP alleles using soluble recombinant proteins expressed by P. pastoris. These recombinant proteins are promising candidates for clinical trials aiming to develop a multiallele vaccine against P. vivax malaria. © 2017 Gimenez, Lima, Françoso, Denapoli, Panatieri, Bargieri, Thiberge, Andolina, Nosten, Renia, Nussenzweig, Nussenzweig, Amino, Rodrigues and Soares.",Circumsporozoite protein; Malaria; Plasmodium vivax; Prime-boost regimens; Recombinant vaccine,CD28 antigen; CD8 antigen; circumsporozoite protein; gamma interferon; interleukin 2; lysosome associated membrane protein 1; recombinant protein; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; animal model; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell activation; controlled study; cytokine production; drug formulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; flow cytometry; gene sequence; genetic variability; immune response; immunization; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence; mouse; nonhuman; parasitemia; Plasmodium vivax; protein expression; protein purification; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography,Article

Vinyl caprate was mechanically dispersed into a solution of sucrose in DMSO. The use of DMSO allowed increasing sucrose concentration up to 0.7 M (in DMSO). The denaturing effect of DMSO on lipase was avoided by pretreatment of lipase by pH adjustment in the presence of crown ether. This pretreatment maintained a significant catalytic activity which led to 0.2 M sucrose monoester within 1 h at 50 °C, which represented higher productivity than already reported.

Ward-based i.e. point of care (POC) testing providing rapid results may alter the clinical management pathway. Methods: FilmArray® RP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems were placed in three in-patient and out-patient medical areas. Patients presenting with influenza-like illness /upper respiratory tract infection +/- lower RTI were recruited between January-July 2015. FilmArray® POC testing occurred on even days of the month (intervention) or routine, laboratory-based RP PCR testing +/- atypical serology on odd days (control). The primary outcome was length of hospital stay. The secondary outcomes were impact on the use of antimicrobials, readmissions, all-cause mortality, length of ward stay and turn-around time (TAT) (time to result from admission). Results: Of 606 eligible patients, 545 (89.9%) were included; 211 in the control arm and 334 in the intervention arm. 20% of control arm patients and 24% of intervention arm patients had an RP detected. POC testing was not associated with the primary outcome measure, length of stay, but reduced the TAT from 39.5h to 19.0h, p<0.001. Only the prescribing decision differed between study arms, p<0.001. When antivirals were given, the intervention was associated with a reduction in the median time to the first dose of 36h and allowed appropriate treatment of mycoplasma infection. Conclusions: We found no association between respiratory PCR POC testing and length of stay or most of the secondary outcomes except the antimicrobial prescribing decision. This was probably due to a delay in initiating FilmArray® testing. Despite this, POC testing allowed time-critical antivirals to be given significantly faster, appropriate mycoplasma treatment and results were available considerably faster than routine, laboratory-based testing. Ward-staff of all grades performed POC testing without difficulty suggesting potential use across many divergent healthcare settings. Further studies evaluating the implementation of rapid respiratory PCR POC testing and the effect on length of stay and antimicrobial use are required.

Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected monthly, from birth to 24 months of age, with additional swabs taken if the infant was diagnosed with pneumonia according to WHO clinical criteria. At the time of collection, swabs were cultured for Streptococcus pneumoniae and multiple serotype carriage was assessed. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiles of 544 swabs from 21 infants were analysed to see how the microbiota changes with age, respiratory infection, antibiotic consumption and pneumococcal acquisition. The nasopharyngeal microbiota is a somewhat homogenous community compared to that of other body sites. In this cohort it is dominated by five taxa: Moraxella, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Corynebacterium and an uncharacterized Flavobacteriaceae taxon of 93% nucleotide similarity to Ornithobacterium. Infant age correlates with certain changes in the microbiota across the cohort: Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium are associated with the first few months of life while Moraxella and the uncharacterised Flavobacteriaceae increase in proportional abundance with age. Respiratory illness and antibiotic use often coincide with an unpredictable perturbation of the microbiota that differs from infant to infant and in different illness episodes. The previously described interaction between Dolosigranulum and Streptococcus was observed in these data. Monthly sampling demonstrates that the nasopharyngeal microbiota is in flux throughout the first two years of life, and that in this refugee camp population the pool of potential bacterial colonisers may be limited. © 2017 Salter et al.",,"antibiotic agent; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; Haemophilus influenzae vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; RNA 16S; antiinfective agent; Acinetobacter; Actinobacillus; age; Article; bacterial flora; child; cohort analysis; Corynebacterium; East Asian; Flavobacteriaceae; Haemophilus; human; human cell; Human respiratory syncytial virus; infant; longitudinal study; Metapneumovirus; Moraxella; nasopharynx; Neisseria; Ornithobacterium; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; refugee camp; respiratory tract infection; serotype; Staphylococcus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; vaccination; bacterium; classification; female; genetics; heterozygote; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; microflora; Moraxellaceae; nasopharynx; newborn; pneumonia; refugee; Respiratory Tract Infections; Age Factors; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Carrier State; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Microbiota; Moraxellaceae; Nasopharynx; Pneumonia; Refugees; Respiratory Tract Infections; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Streptococcus pneumoniae",Article

Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among nine tertiary hospitals in Thailand. Stroke patients from the Thai Stroke Rehabilitation Registry who were admitted in inpatient rehabilitation wards were recruited for evaluation at the 12-month follow-up time point. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate depression in stroke. A score of ≥11 was considered as having depression. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to investigate factors related with depression in stroke. Results: Two hundred stroke patients with a mean age of 62.1±12.5 years were recruited. Approximately 60% were male. The number of stroke patients with depression at the 12-month follow-up was 42 (21.0%, 95%CI 15.9%–27.2%). Mean HADS score at 12-month follow-up was not significantly different from those at discharge. However, 28 (16.5%) stroke patients who did not have depression at discharge developed depression during the 12-month period. From multivariate analysis, complications and urinary incontinence were found to be significantly associated with depression after stroke with adjusted odds ratio of 3.65 (95%CI 1.11–12.06) and 4.82 (95%CI 1.74–13.38), respectively. Conclusion: Depression is a common complication after stroke. This study found one-fifth of stroke survivors developed depression at the 12-month follow-up. Complications at discharge and urinary incontinence were significantly correlated with depression in multivariate analysis. Further study concerning interventions in decreasing depression should be performed in order to improve the quality of life of those stroke patients. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",depression; HADS; rehabilitation; Stroke,adult; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical evaluation; confidence interval; contracture; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; decubitus; deep vein thrombosis; feces incontinence; female; follow up; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; hospital patient; human; infection; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; musculoskeletal pain; odds ratio; post-stroke depression; prevalence; prospective study; rehabilitation center; risk factor; spasticity; statistical analysis; stroke patient; tertiary care center; Thailand; univariate analysis; urine incontinence; aged; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; complication; depression; follow up; psychology; quality of life; stroke rehabilitation; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Thailand,Article

Wheat has recently been recognized as a more common cause of food-induced anaphylaxis than previously recognized, especially among young children, around the world. In wheat allergic patients, avoidance recommended as standard recommendation is not easy to follow, because wheat has been used as a common constituents in various kinds of consumed foods in every day's life.

Synthesis of the RhD blood group involves multiple factors causing variation in the expression of RHD antigens. The mechanism underlying the extremely weak expression of RHD antigen associated with the RHD variant called DEL (D-elute) is incompletely understood. Down-regulation of gene expression through miRNA is a guide to the potential involvement of miRNAs in the DEL blood group. In order to determine the association of miRNAs and Rh-DEL blood donors with DEL variant, we investigated the expression level RHD-specific miRNA. Methods: Blood samples were serologically tested for RhD blood group determination. DNA was analysed using SSP-PCR for the Asian-type DEL allele (RHD 1227 G>A). Bioinformatics analyses were applied for prediction of candidate RHD-specific miRNA. The RHD-specific miRNA expression level was quantitated using a real-time-qPCR approach. The miRNA expression levels of various RhD blood groups were compared and statistically analysed. Results: The bioinformatics tools (n = 3) for prediction of miRNA targeting on RHD identified miR-98 as the miRNA potentially specific for the 3′ UTR of RHD. The relative expression levels of miR-98 among D-positive (n = 50), D-negative (n = 49) and DEL (n = 63) subjects showed no statistically significant differences (P-values = 0.58). Conclusion: This is the first attempt to determine whether miR-98 is involved in RHD expression using computational and experimental approaches. Further investigations are necessary to fully characterize the miRNA genetics in DEL blood group regulation. © 2017 British Journal of Biomedical Science.",DEL; genetics; microRNA; RHD; transfusion medicine,genomic DNA; microRNA; rhesus D antibody; 3' untranslated region; antibody production; Article; blood donor; blood group; blood group typing; blood sampling; comparative study; controlled study; del blood group; DNA determination; DNA extraction; down regulation; gene expression; human; human cell; nonhuman; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; protein secondary structure; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; RNA hybridization; supernatant,Article

We attribute the strong leukemogenic activity of oncogenic Kras to 2 unique aspects of Kras signaling. First, Kras is required in mediating cell type- and cytokine-specific ERK1/2 signaling. Second, oncogenic Kras, but not oncogenic Nras, induces hyperactivation of wild-type Ras, which significantly enhances Ras signaling in vivo.

It includes a network of microRNAs (miRNAs), such as let-7, and protein-coding genes, such as the stemness factors, LIN-28 and LIN-41. Here we identified the acn-1 gene, a homologue of mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), as a new suppressor of the stem cell developmental defects of let-7 mutants. Since acn-1 null mutants die during early larval development, we used RNAi to characterize the role of acn-1 in C. elegans seam cell development, and determined its interaction with heterochronic factors, including let-7 and its downstream interactors–lin-41, hbl-1, and apl-1. We demonstrate that although RNAi knockdown of acn-1 is insufficient to cause heterochronic defects on its own, loss of acn-1 suppresses the retarded phenotypes of let-7 mutants and enhances the precocious phenotypes of hbl-1, though not lin-41, mutants. Conversely, the pattern of acn-1 expression, which oscillates during larval development, is disrupted by lin-41 mutants but not by hbl-1 mutants. Finally, we show that acn-1(RNAi) enhances the let-7-suppressing phenotypes caused by loss of apl-1, a homologue of the Alzheimer's disease-causing amyloid precursor protein (APP), while significantly disrupting the expression of apl-1 during the L4 larval stage. In conclusion, acn-1 interacts with heterochronic genes and appears to function downstream of let-7 and its target genes, including lin-41 and apl-1. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",acn-1; APP; developmental timing; heterochronic genes; let-7; lin-41,amyloid precursor protein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; microRNA; microRNA let 7; unclassified drug; acn 1 gene; Alzheimer disease; Article; Caenorhabditis elegans; cell maturation; gene; gene interaction; genome-wide association study; hbl 1 gene; larval development; larval stage; lin 41 gene; nonhuman; protozoal genetics; RNA interference,Article

In this study, we have compared multi-element hair profiles between healthy and ADHD Thai children. In addition, the correlations between bioelements and ADHD symptoms according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, diagnostic criteria were identified. A case-control study was conducted in 111 Thai children (45 newly diagnosed ADHD and 66 matched healthy), aged 3–7 years, living in Bangkok and suburban areas. Levels of 39 bioelements in hair were measured by ICP-MS. Among the analyzed bioelements, Cu/Zn and P/Zn ratios in ADHD children were significantly lower than those in healthy children. Indeed, increased hair Zn level was correlated with more symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and total ADHD symptoms. Higher Zn content was also associated with being female and older age. Furthermore, Zn in hair was positively correlated with levels of Ca, Mg, and P; however, it showed a negative correlation with Al, As, Fe, and Mo.

Previous research on preventive healthcare behaviors has been predominantly cross-sectional, ignoring the dynamic nature of people’s health behaviors over a full life span. As a result, the reasons for the development, stability, and changes of individuals’ preventive healthcare behaviors over time remain relatively unknown. Our article contends that to understand the degree of people’s engagement in preventive healthcare behaviors, we must understand the origins, continuity, and discontinuity of such behaviors. We offer the life course paradigm as a viable framework for studying preventive healthcare behaviors at different stages in life. Based on theory and previous research, our article proposes that the onset, continuity, and changes in preventive healthcare behaviors are the outcomes of physical, social, and emotional demands triggered by life events that require adaptation through the mechanisms of socialization, stress and coping, and human development. These mechanisms are the underlying change processes of the three main life course theoretical perspectives—normative, stress, and human capital, respectively. Our paper discusses implications of adopting the life course approach for theory and practice, and offers a research agenda in the form of general propositions and conceptual directions for future research. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Adaptation processes; Health behaviors; Life course perspectives; Preventive healthcare,health behavior; human; human development; life event; socialization; stress; theoretical model,Review

Objective: To determine the success rate of the protocol for attaining vitamin D sufficiency and to identify factors that associate with the success of correcting low vitamin D status. Material and Method: Medical records of patients who sought treatment at the Siriraj Metabolic Bone Disease Clinic between March 2012 and December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients who had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels available at both baseline and three months post-treatment were included. Treatment protocol according to 25(OH)D level was, as follows: 60,000, 40,000, 20,000, and 0 IU per week for patients with baseline serum 25(OH)D level of less than 20, 20 to less than 30, 30 to 40, and more than 40 ng/mL, respectively. Results: Two hundred and forty-three patients entered the study and 187 patients (77%) had serum 25(OH)D level 30 ng/mL or more, after treatment with our stratified vitamin D2 supplementation protocol. This proportion increased to 98.4% when 20 ng/mL was used as the cut-off value for adequate vitamin D status. In addition, we found body mass index (BMI) and baseline vitamin D level to be associated with attainment of vitamin D sufficiency status after treatment with our vitamin D2 supplementation protocol. Conclusion: Our stratified vitamin D2 supplementation protocol was effective in attaining vitamin D sufficiency status in approximately 77% of patients. Since baseline vitamin D level and BMI were found to be two important factors that influence the success of treating hypovitaminosis D, these two factors should be considered before and during treatment for low vitamin D level. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

Beta oscillation is also involved in interpreting received stimulus and occurs following gamma oscillation, and this process is known as gamma-to-beta transition, a process for neglecting unnecessary stimuli in surrounding environment. Gamma oscillation also associates with cognitive functions, memory and emotion. Therefore, modulation of the brain activity can lead to manipulation of cognitive functions. The stimulus used in this study was 40-Hz binaural beat because binaural beat induces frequency following response. This study aimed to investigate the neural oscillation responding to the 40-Hz binaural beat and to evaluate working memory function and emotional states after listening to that stimulus. Two experiments were developed based on the study aims. In the first experiment, electroencephalograms were recorded while participants listened to the stimulus for 30 min. The results suggested that frontal, temporal, and central regions were activated within 15 min. In the second experiment, word list recall task was conducted before and after listening to the stimulus for 20 min. The results showed that, after listening, the recalled words were increase in the working memory portion of the list. Brunel Mood Scale, a questionnaire to evaluate emotional states, revealed changes in emotional states after listening to the stimulus. The emotional results suggested that these changes were consistent with the induced neural oscillations. © 2017",Beta oscillation; Binaural beat; Emotion; Gamma oscillation; Memory,electroencephalogram; experimental model; female; frontal cortex; human; human experiment; male; modulation; mood; oscillation; questionnaire; stimulus; temporal lobe; word list recall; working memory,Article

Although brace compliance after initial correction was previously found to be significantly associated with recurrence in clubfoot, few previous studies have specifically examined evertor muscle function as a factor that contributes to recurrence in children with idiopathic and non-idiopathic clubfoot. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship among brace compliance, evertor muscle grading, and recurrence rate in pediatric clubfoot patients. Methods: Children with idiopathic clubfoot who were treated and followed for a minimum of 2 years were included. Patients who used their brace <20–23 h a day for the first 3 months and then <8–10 h per day during sleep and nap times thereafter were classified as group I. Patients who complied fully by using the brace 23 h a day for the first 3 months and then 8–10 h per day during sleep and nap times thereafter were classified as group II. Demographic and clinical data including age, gender, follow-up time, recurrence, evertor muscle grading, types of surgery, brace compliance, severity of initial deformity, age at onset, number of casts required for initial correction, and the need for Achilles tenotomy were collected and analyzed. Results: Seventy-nine children with clubfoot were included. There were 47 males and 32 females, mean age was 3.2 years (range 2.1–6.3), and the mean follow-up time was 31.4 months. All patients had follow-up of at least 2 years. Primary correction was obtained in all children. There was no significant difference in mean age, mean follow-up time, or recurrence rate between groups. There was, however, a statistically significant difference in mean brace time between groups (p = 0.002). The recurrence rate was 26.2% in group I and 22.2% in group II. The recurrence rate in group a (Pirani score 0) was 3.9%, group b (Pirani score 0.5) 43.8%, and group c (Pirani score 1) 75% (p < 0.001). No significant association was found between severity of the initial deformity, age at the onset of treatment, number of casts required for correction, or reported brace compliance and recurrence or rates of surgery. Only poor or absent evertor muscle activity was found to be statistically significantly associated with risk of recurrence. Conclusion: Good evertor muscle grading was found to be a significant protective factor against recurrence of idiopathic clubfoot. Thus, improvement in muscle balance around the ankle, especially the evertor muscle, should be emphasized to parents after the casting regimen is completed and correction is achieved. © 2017, Springer-Verlag France.",Deformity; Evertor muscle activity; Idiopathic clubfoot; Predictor; Recurrence,achilles tendon; age; Article; brace; child; clubfoot; controlled study; demography; evertor muscle; female; follow up; gender; human; idiopathic disease; major clinical study; male; muscle contraction; pediatrics; prediction; priority journal; recurrence risk; recurrent disease; skeletal muscle; sleep; tenotomy,Article

To obtain the most accurate data, hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay was employed as the screening test; and sera with HI antibody titers 20 were further confirmed by other methods, including cytopathic effect/hemagglutination based-microneutralization (microNT) and Western blot (WB) assays using H1N1pdm matrix 1 (M1) or hemagglutinin (HA) recombinant protein as the test antigen. Conclusively, the appropriate assays using HI in conjunction with WB assays for HA antibody revealed an overall seropositive rate of 8.5% (27 of 317). The prevalence of antibody to H1N1pdm virus was 2% (4/172) in 2009, 32% (17/53) in 2010, 9% (2/22) in 2011, 12% (1/8) in 2012, and 5% (3/62) in 2013. Notably, these positive serum samples were collected from elephants living in 7 tourist provinces of Thailand. The highest seropositive rate was obtained from elephants in Phuket, a popular tourist beach city. Young elephants had higher seropositive rate than older elephants. The source of H1N1pdm viral infection in these elephants was not explored, but most likely came from close contact with the infected mahouts or from the infected tourists who engaged in activities such as elephant riding and feeding. Nevertheless, it could not be excluded that elephant-to-elephant transmission did occur. © 2017 Paungpin et al.

Porous scaffolds were obtained by freeze drying the combinations. The mechanical properties and in vitro growth of rat osteoblast-like UMR-106 cells were investigated. The investigation indicated that the compressive strength was controlled by the types of CaP. The highest compressive modulus of the composites was 479.77 MPa (23.84 MPa for compressive strength) which is for the BCPBG@ChiCol composite. Compressive modulus of 459.01 and 435.95 MPa with compressive strength of 22.73 and 17.89 MPa were observed for the HABG@ChiCol and TCPBG@ChiCol composites, respectively. In vitro cell availability and proliferation tests confirmed the osteoblast attachment and growth on the CaPBG@ChiCol surface. Comparing the scaffolds, cells grown on the BCPBG based composite showed the higher cell density. To test its bioactivity, BCPBG@ChiCol was chosen for MTT and ALP assays on UMR-106 cells. The results indicated that the UMR-106 cells were viable and had higher ALP activity as the culturing times were increased.

Material and Method: One thousand one hundred thirty six clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infections or lower respiratory tract infections in 2016 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, tigecycline, imipenem, meropenem, and colistin were determined by standard agar dilution method. Results: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Sitafloxacin was more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, but it was less active than piperacillin-tazobactam, tigecycline, imipenem, meropenem, and colistin against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates. Sitafloxacin was more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. The activity of sitafloxacin against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was comparable to piperacillin-tazobactam, but it was less active than tigecycline, imipenem, meropenem, and colistin. Sitafloxacin was more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem, but it was less active than colistin against A. baumannii isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against P. aeruginosa isolates was comparable to levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem, but it was less active than colistin. The in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates was more than levofloxacin, but it was less than vancomycin. The activities of sitafloxacin against tested bacteria isolated from the patients in 2016 were not significantly different from those isolated in 2010. Conclusion: Sitafloxacin remains active against the common antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections in Thai patients isolated in 2016, including ESBL-producing E. coli, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus, after its use in Thailand for five years. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

Diagnosis of pythiosis is difficult and often delayed. Surgical removal of infected tissue is the main treatment option. Disabilities and death are common outcomes for pythiosis patients. Reports of Py. insidiosum infections are rising. While it would be useful for clinical, epidemiological, and microbiological studies, information on genetic variation in Py. insidiosum strains is limited. This limitation is, at least in part, due to the cost and time-requirements of DNA sequencing procedures. rDNA-sequence-based phylogenetic analyses categorize Py. insidiosum into three groups, in relation to geographic distribution: Clade-I (American strains), Clade-II (American, Asian, and Australian strains), and Clade-III (Thai and American strains). In rDNA sequence analyses, we observed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that were associated with the phylogenetic clades of Py. insidiosum. In this study, we aim to develop a multiplex PCR assay, targeting the identified SNPs, for rapid genotyping of Py. insidiosum. We also aim to assess diagnostic efficiency of the assay for identification of Py. insidiosum. Fifty-three isolates of Py. insidiosum from humans (n = 35), animals (n = 14), and the environment (n = 4), and 22 negative-control fungi were recruited for assay evaluation. Based on the pattern of amplicons, the multiplex PCR correctly assigned phylogenetic clades in 98% of the Py. insidiosum isolates tested. The assay exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity for identification of Py. insidiosum. The assay successfully identified and genotyped the first proven isolate of Py. insidiosum from an animal with pythiosis in Thailand. In conclusion, the multiplex PCR provided accurate, sensitive and specific results for identifying and genotyping Py. insidiosum. Thus, this multiplex-PCR assay could be a simple, rapid, and cost-effective alternative to DNA sequencing for the identification and genotyping of Py. insidiosum. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Detection; Genotyping; Multiplex PCR; Pythiosis; Pythium insidiosum; rDNA,"ribosome DNA; animal; Asia; Australia; classification; genetics; genotyping technique; horse; human; isolation and purification; mosquito; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; parasitology; phylogeny; phylogeography; pythiosis; Pythium; single nucleotide polymorphism; Western Hemisphere; Americas; Animals; Asia; Australia; Culicidae; DNA, Ribosomal; Genotyping Techniques; Horses; Humans; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Pythiosis; Pythium",Article

Mean respiratory rates at 60 minutes postintervention were lower in the high-flow nasal cannula group (21.8 versus 25.1 breaths/min; difference 3.3; 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 4.6). No significant differences were found in the admission rate, ED and hospital lengths of stay, noninvasive ventilation, intubation, or mortality.

Methods Ten de novo KT recipients who received full exposure cyclosporine (CsA) and prednisolone as initial therapy were enrolled. Initial CsA minimization was 50% and started at day 7 after KT. This was synchronized with everolimus (EVL) initiation. Target trough level of EVL was 3–8 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetics studies of CsA and EVL were studied at week 4. The CsA dosage was further reduced to keep a lowest value of serum creatinine and a target EVL level. Primary outcomes were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and last follow-up. Results Patients' mean age at last follow-up was 60.6 ± 11.7 years. Follow-up duration was 121.6 ± 12.8 months. Pharmacokinetics study found that Cmax of CsA ranged from 309 to 1,896 ng/mL, mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of CsA was 3,449 ± 1,402 ng·h/mL, C0 of EVL was 5.2 ± 1.5 ng/mL, Cmax of EVL was 15.4 ± 4.6 ng/mL, and AUC of EVL was 99.7 ± 26.1 ng·h/mL. Achieved nadir serum creatinine was 1.03 ± 0.33 mg/dL. Achieved best eGFR (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) was 99.7 ± 26 mL/min. eGFR at 12 months was 82 ± 25 mL/min. Last serum creatinine was 1.32 ± 0.45 mg/dL. Last eGFR was 57.2 ± 13.55 mL/min. Actuarial death-censored 10-year graft survival was 100%. Actuarial 10-year patient survival was 80%.

Based on the live attenuated vaccine strategy, the commercial vaccine has a less than optimal protective profile. Virus-like particles (VLPs) offer an attractive alternate vaccination strategy due to the effectively native presentation of epitopes in the absence of any infectious genetic material. However, the production of amounts of VLP in a platform that can support commercial development remains a major obstacle. This study generated two DENV 2 VLPs [codon-optimized and chimeric DENV/Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)] and directly compared yields of these constructs by western blotting and dot blot hybridization. The effect of oleic acid supplementation, a process known to increase DENV production in natural infection, was also investigated. Results showed that the chimeric construct gave a two- to threefold higher yield than the codon-optimized construct and that while oleic acid increased DENV virion production in natural infection, it inhibited VLP production. These results suggest that further optimization of DENV VLP expression is possible, but it will require more understanding of how native DENV infection remodels the host cell machinery. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Dengue virus; Electron microscopy; Expression; Oleic acid; Virus-like particle,Electron microscopy; Machinery; Mammals; Oleic acid; Vaccines; Commercial development; Dengue virus; Dot-blot hybridization; Expression; Genetic materials; Live attenuated vaccines; Vaccination strategy; Virus-like particles; Viruses; oleic acid; antigen antibody complex; Article; codon; controlled study; dengue; Dengue virus 2; dot hybridization; HEK293T/17 cell line; host cell; human; human cell; Japanese encephalitis virus; lipid metabolism; nonhuman; virion; virus like agent; Western blotting,Article

Methods: A cross-sectional paper-based questionnaire survey was conducted among Myanmar dental professionals who worked in one of two teaching hospitals or in private dental clinics. Descriptive data were analyzed and regression analysis was carried out to identify factors influencing perceptions of electronic dental records. Results: Most dental professionals (>60%) were satisfied with just three out of six aspects of paper-based dental records (familiarity, flexibility, and portability). In addition, generalized positive perceptions were found among decision makers towards electronic dental records, and 86% of dentists indicated that they were willing to use them. Financial concerns were identified as the most important barrier to the implementation of electronic dental records among dentists who were not willing to use the proposed system. Conclusions: The first step towards implementing electronic dental records in Myanmar should be improvement of the content and structure of paper-based dental records, especially in private dental clinics. Utilization of appropriate open-source electronic dental record software in private dental clinics is recommended to address perceived issues around financial barriers.

Over 10,000 bacterial isolates from water, environment and clinical samples were screened. E. faecalis strain 478 isolated from human feces produced the highest antibacterial activity against several MDRE and VRE strains. The optimum condition for bacteriocin production was cultivation in MRS broth at 37°C, pH 5–6 for 16 hours. The bacteriocin-like substance produced from E. faecalis strain EF478 was stable at 60°C for at least 1 hour and retained its antimicrobial activity after storage at -20°C for 1 year, at 4°C for 6 months, and at 25°C for 2 months.

Using the prognostic markers in both cancer cells and tumor stroma are of benefit for providing an accurate prediction of disease progression. We found that high ASMA+ fibroblasts and low HMGB1 in cancer cells are the most reliable predictors of metastatic relapse. Introduction The influence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been recognized in several cancers, although their roles in breast cancer are unclear. The present study aimed to determine the levels and prognostic significance of α-smooth muscle actin-positive (ASMA+) CAFs, plus HMGB1 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in cancer cells. Materials and Methods A total of 127 breast samples, including 96 malignant and 31 benign, were examined for ASMA, HMGB1, and RAGE by immunohistochemistry. The χ2 test and Fisher's exact test were used to test the association of each protein with clinicopathologic parameters. The Kaplan-Meier method or log-rank test and Cox regression were used for survival analysis. Results ASMA+ fibroblast infiltration was significantly increased in the tumor stroma compared with that in benign breast tissue. The levels of cytoplasmic HMGB1 and RAGE were significantly greater in the breast cancer tissue than in the benign breast tissues. High ASMA expression correlated significantly with large tumor size, clinical stage III-IV, and angiolymphatic and perinodal invasion. In contrast, increased cytoplasmic HMGB1 correlated significantly with small tumor size, pT stage, early clinical stage, luminal subtype (but not triple-negative subtype), and estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression. The levels of ASMA (hazard ratio, 14.162; P =.010) and tumor cytoplasmic HMGB1 (hazard ratio, 0.221; P =.005) could serve as independent prognostic markers for metastatic relapse in breast cancer patients. The ASMA-high/HMGB1-low profile provided the most reliable prediction of metastatic relapse. Conclusion We present for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the potential clinical implications of the combined assessment of ASMA+ fibroblasts and cytoplasmic HMGB1 in breast cancer. © 2017 The Authors",Breast cancer; High mobility group box 1; Metastasis-free survival; RAGE; α-Smooth muscle actin,advanced glycation end product receptor; alpha smooth muscle actin; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; high mobility group B1 protein; progesterone receptor; adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; adjuvant therapy; adult; age; angiogenesis; Article; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; breast carcinoma; breast tissue; breast tumor; cancer associated fibroblast; cancer grading; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cancer tissue; cohort analysis; controlled study; cytoplasm; disease association; female; gene expression; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; inflammatory breast cancer; luminal A breast cancer; luminal B breast cancer; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; metastasis potential; metastatic breast cancer; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; oncogenesis and malignant transformation; predictive value; recurrence risk; stroma; survival analysis; tumor differentiation; tumor invasion; tumor stroma; tumor volume,Article

This research utilized a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, which found that losses of resources had major negative impacts on real gross domestic product (GDP). Transitioning from national catastrophe insurance fund to an international risk pooling approach is discussed, and as the Global Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility has not yet been established, our proposal suggests the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus three (ASEAN + 3) Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (ACRIF) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus three catastrophic bonds (ASEAN + 3 CAT bonds) as effective means of reducing fiscal liabilities arising from natural disasters, also effectively enhancing disaster risk reduction. These tools are complementary to Catastrophe Risk Swaps which are innovative global financial adaptation strategies designed to make communities and governments more resilient to disaster damages. They are ex-ante risk financing tools and sources of liquidity for damage restoration and economic recovery, which facilitates flexibility among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus three (ASEAN + 3) and other governments requiring special assistance.

We aimed to develop and validate a screening tool, and investigate the prevalence of parkinsonism and PD via a community survey. Methods: A PD-screening tool comprising 11 ""yes/no"" items was developed in a clinical setting and validated in the community. The prevalence of PD and parkinsonism was investigated in a survey that included PD screening tools, face-to-face interviews, and physical examinations. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for a range of cutoff points to explore the screening tool's sensitivity and specificity. Results: Of 1,846 participants surveyed, the mean age was 64.4 ± 8.0 years. The age-standardized prevalence of parkinsonism was 1,954 per 100,000 people, and that of PD was 706. Of 36 parkinsonism cases, 13 were PD, 13 were vascular parkinsonism, 8 were drug-induced parkinsonism, and 2 were head-injury related. Three cases were previously diagnosed with PD. A cutoff score of 5 on the screening tool showed a sensitivity of 98%, a specificity of 94%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 16.33 and 0.02, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.985. Conclusions: The prevalence of parkinsonism and PD in Thailand is similar to that in Western countries but slightly higher than that for other Asian countries. Differing methodologies, diagnostic criteria, and case identification strategies may contribute to variations in the reported prevalence of PD. Widespread use of the Thai PD-screening tool should be implemented to facilitate early detection of new cases and, in turn, better healthcare. © 2017 S.

Natural rubber (NR) contains different natural occurring materials and this brings about subtle complexities in controlling compound and vulcanizate properties. Thus, the aim of this paper is to illustrate that the properties of compounds and vulcanizates of NR/clay prepared from fresh field latex and from concentrated latex are different. Different amounts of pristine clay were added to the two latices and their viscosity determined. The latex mixtures were next coagulated to form solid filled rubbers and their properties examined. Vulcanizates of these solid rubbers were then prepared and their properties, also, were determined. The cause of an observed variation is attributed to soluble proteins in the fresh field latex. Structural models to explain this are proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Interaction; Natural rubber latex; Pristine clay; Protein,Compounding (chemical); Fillers; Latexes; Proteins; Rubber; Comparative studies; Filled rubbers; Interaction; Natural rubber latex; Pristine clay; Rubber/clay nanocomposites; Soluble proteins; Structural models; Rubber compounding,Article

Aggregability of thalassemic red blood cells (RBCs) and increased red blood cell-derived microparticles (RMPs) expressing phosphatidylserine (PS) are thought to participate in thromboembolic events by initially triggering platelet activation. To our knowledge, there has been no report providing quantitation of these circulating PS-expressing RBCs and RMPs in young β-thalassemia patients after BMT. Whole blood from each subject was fluorescently labeled to detect RBC markers (CD235a) and annexin-V together with the known number TruCount™ beads. PS-expressing RBCs, RMPs, and activated platelets were identified by flow cytometry. In our randomized study, we found the decreased levels of three aforementioned factors compared to levels in patients receiving regular blood transfusion (RT). This study showed that BMT in β-thalassemia patients decreases the levels of circulating PS-expressing RBCs, their MPs, and procoagulant platelets when compared to patients who received RT.

As a result, serum phosphate remains relatively low in association with increased serum calcium and urinary phosphate excretion when compared to chronic kidney disease patients. The relationship between mineral metabolism and outcomes in long-term KT recipients has not been extensively studied. This study investigated whether the alteration in mineral metabolism influenced graft survival in long-term KT recipients. Methods: This study included 273 KT recipients after 1 year of transplantation. Mineral parameters were obtained at the time of enrolment and patients were followed prospectively for an average of 71 months. Results: Graft loss (death-censored) occurred in 41 (15%) patients. In univariate analysis, deceased donor transplantation, decreased serum albumin and estimated glomerular filtration rate, increased serum phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), FGF-23 and fractional excretion of phosphate (FePi) predicted future allograft loss. After adjustments for cardiovascular disease risk factors, donor type, dialysis vintage, serum albumin and allograft function, only increased PTH and FePi remained associated with the outcome. Relationships between increased serum phosphate and FGF-23 with graft survival were lost after adjustments. Adjusted survival curves revealed the association between PTH > 90 pg/mL and FePi > 20% with worse graft survival.

Methods We performed a retrospective review from 2002 to 2014 of all patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for bullous systemic lupus erythematosus to evaluate for the clinical characteristics, extracutaneous involvement, histopathologic features, immunofluorescence pattern, serological abnormalities, internal organ involvement, treatments and outcome. Results Among 5149 patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus and/or systemic lupus erythematosus, 15 developed vesiculobullous lesions. Ten patients had validation of the diagnosis of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus, accounting for 0.19%. Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus occurred after the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in six patients with a median onset of 2.5 months (0-89). Four out of 10 patients developed bullous systemic lupus erythematosus simultaneously with systemic lupus erythematosus. Hematologic abnormalities and renal involvement were found in 100% and 90%, respectively. Polyarthritis (40%) and serositis (40%) were less frequently seen. Systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, antimalarials and dapsone offered resolution of cutaneous lesions. Conclusion Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus is an uncommon presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Blistering can occur following or simultaneously with established systemic lupus erythematosus.

However, in the elderly patient, the efficacy of this procedure is still unknown. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the survivorship of MOWHTO in elderly patients as the primary outcome. The secondary outcome is to evaluate the loss of correction angle that is the common complication after MOWTHO. Materials and method: A retrospective study of 50 elderly patients (≥ 60 years) was conducted to track survivorship of MOWHTO. All patients were diagnosed with varus OA knee and underwent MOWHTO at our institute. The patients who had previous knee surgery or incomplete data were excluded. Medical records and radiographs of eligible patients were reviewed for recruiting the data. Survivorship of MOWHTO was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. The starting point was the time of operation and the end point was the time of subsequent TKA. The loss of correction angle was defined as the change of medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) between three months and one year post-operatively. Results: The mean age of patients was 66 ± 5.0 years. The majority of patients were female (74%). The mean correction angle was 10.6 ± 3.6 degrees. The union rate of osteotomy site was 100%. In survival analysis, the median follow-up time was 6.0 ± 3.0 years. Two patients required subsequent conversions to TKA. The survivorship of MOWHTO at four years was 95.5% (95%CI, 96.0 to 98.0). For radiographic assessment, the loss of correction angle was 1.0 ± 0.5 degrees at one year post-operatively. Conclusion: This study proved that MOWHTO in patient ≥60 years had good mid-term survivorship with acceptable complications.

Aberrant expression of RUNX1 led to proliferation and metastasis of several cancers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of RUNX1 in migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of human glioblastoma using IL-1β-treated U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells as a model. IL-1β at 10 ng/ml stimulated translocation of RUNX1 into the nucleus with increased expressions of RUNX1, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-19, and VEGFA in U-87 MG cells. In addition, silencing of RUNX1 gene significantly suppressed U-87 MG cell migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, knockdown of RUNX1 mRNA in U-87 MG cells reduced the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Further investigation revealed that IL-1β-induced RUNX1 expression might be mediated via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling molecule for the expression of these invasion- and angiogenic-related molecules.

Here, potential producers of Streptomyces hormones were investigated in 40 Streptomyces and 11 endophytic actinomycetes. Production of 3-butyrolactone-type (IM-2, VB) and butenolide-type (avenolide) Streptomyces hormones was screened using Streptomyces lavendulae FRI-5 (""farX), Streptomyces virginiae (""barX) and Streptomyces avermitilis (""aco), respectively. In these strains, essential biosynthetic genes for Streptomyces hormones were disrupted, enabling them to respond solely to the externally added hormones. The results showed that 20% of each of the investigated strains produced IM-2 and VB, confirming that 3-butyrolactone-type Streptomyces hormones are the most common in actinomycetes. Unlike the 3-butyrolactone type, butenolide-type Streptomyces hormones have been discovered in recent years, but their distribution has been unclear. Our finding that 24% of actinomycetes (12 of 51 strains) showed avenolide activity revealed for the first time that the butenolide-type Streptomyces hormone is also common in actinomycetes. © 2017 Japan Antibiotics Research Association All rights reserved.",,acetic acid ethyl ester; bambermycin; butenolide; citrinin; factor A; gamma butyrolactone; kinamycin; spiramycin; streptomycin; pheromone; Actinobacteria; antimicrobial activity; Article; bacterial strain; chemical structure; hormone action; nonhuman; priority journal; Streptomyces; Streptomyces avermitilis; Streptomyces lavendulae; Streptomyces virginiae; chemistry; classification; gene inactivation; genetics; mass screening; metabolism; microbiological examination; Streptomyces; Gene Knockout Techniques; Mass Screening; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Microbiological Techniques; Pheromones; Streptomyces,Article

Methods: The total sample consisted of 30284 adolescents aged 13 - 15 years from seven ASEAN countries that were included in the cross-sectional “global school-based student health survey” (GSHS) between 2007 and 2013. Results: The prevalence of “being in a physical fight in the past 12 months” across seven ASEAN countries (excluding Brunei) was 30.1%, ranging from below 15% in Cambodia and Myanmar to more than 30% in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, sociodemographic factors (younger age, being male, the experience of hunger) and risk behavior (sedentary behavior, ever had sex, tobacco use, alcohol use, truancy, being bullied, and having sustained an injury) were found to be associated with “having been in a physical fight” in the past year. Lack of protective social-familial factors (low peer support and low parental or guardian support) were only associated with physical fighting in bivariate analyses.

Infection can cause microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that ZIKV is sexually transmitted, especially from infected males to uninfected females. This study aimed to investigate the transmission pattern of ZIKV in semen using boar semen. Experiments were performed ex vivo using semen from healthy boar. The samples were infected with ZIKV, and viral RNA was detected and cell morphology was examined at different time points postinfection. ZIKV infection was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Viral RNA levels were found to markedly decrease as the time postinfection increased, without any evidence of virus replication. The sperm showed no significant changes in morphology. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of virus-free sperm, suggesting that ZIKV cannot replicate in boar semen. We suggest three possible reasons underlying this phenomenon. First, the spermatozoa of boar might not be the target of ZIKV associated with sexual transmission. Second, the effect of the external environment on spermatozoa may affect ZIKV replication. Third, ZIKV may not be tropic for spermatozoa. This ex vivo study might be used as a platform to study the association of sexual transmission with ZIKV in other longer-lasting cells, such as Leydig or Sertoli cells. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",,"animal; isolation and purification; male; physiology; pig; sperm; spermatozoon; transmission electron microscopy; virology; Zika virus; Animals; Male; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Semen; Spermatozoa; Swine; Zika Virus",Article

Most of the epicenters were located in the transition region between the Mae Lao Segment (MLS) and the Pan Segment (PS) of the Phayao Fault Zone (PFZ). We conducted a 3-D magnetotelluric (MT) survey (31 sites) to image the deep PFZ structure. The shallow 3-D resistivity structure matches very well with the surface geology, while the deeper structures disclose many interesting resistive and conductive anomalies. However, the most interesting feature of this study is the large conductive anomaly (ML) located at a depth of 4 km to the mid-crust beneath the MLS near the seismogenic zone. Our current hypothesis is that the ML conductor has a highly interconnected aqueous fluid content and also plays crucial role in the earthquake sequence of the 5 May 2014 event. As our previous seismic waveform study revealed that the MLS has a relatively high fault plane instability, the fluid within the fractured fault would further reduce the fault strength. The accumulated pre-existing tectonic stress from the north can therefore overcome the maximum frictional strength of the MLS, and hence cause it to slip and produce the main shock. With the local structural heterogeneities and fluid in the fractured fault zones, the aftershocks then occurred on both the PS and MLS. This is in contrast to the Mae Chan Fault Zone (MCFZ) in the north which many scientists expected to generate a larger magnitude earthquake than any other faults. Since instrumental record, it has only generated a few Mw 4 earthquakes. Some of our MT stations were located within the MCFZ. However, there is no deep conductor as the conductor lies beneath the MLS. A lack of interconnected fluid within the deep fault beneath the MCFZ might be one of the reasons for the lower seismic activity from the MCFZ. Other geophysical methods, such as seismic tomography, are necessary in order to confirm the presence of the fluid beneath the MLS and also the lack of a deep conductor beneath the MCFZ. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Earthquake; Fluid; Magnetotelluric; Northern Thailand; Phayao Fault Zone,aftershock; anomaly; earthquake; fault plane; fault zone; fluid; magnetotelluric method; seismic source; tectonics; Phayao Fault Zone; Thailand,Article

Here, we observe that glucose-grown cells of B. cereus ATCC 14579 form longer chains than those grown in the absence of glucose during the late exponential and transition growth phases, and identify that the clhAB2 operon is required for this chain lengthening phenotype. The clhAB2 operon is specific to the B. cereus group (i.e., B. thuringiensis, B. anthracis and B. cereus) and encodes two membrane proteins of unknown function, which are homologous to the Staphylococcus aureus CidA and CidB proteins involved in cell death control within glucose-grown cells. A deletion mutant (ΔclhAB2) was constructed and our quantitative image analyses show that ΔclhAB2 cells formed abnormal short chains regardless of the presence of glucose. We also found that glucose-grown cells of ΔclhAB2 were significantly wider than wild-type cells (1.47 μm ±CI95% 0.04 vs 1.19 μm ±CI95% 0.03, respectively), suggesting an alteration of the bacterial cell wall. Remarkably, ΔclhAB2 cells showed accelerated autolysis under autolysis-inducing conditions, compared to wild-type cells. Overall, our data suggest that the B. cereus clhAB2 operon modulates peptidoglycan hydrolase activity, which is required for proper cell shape and chain length during cell growth, and down-regulates autolysin activity. Lastly, we studied the transcription of clhAB2 using a lacZ transcriptional reporter in wild-type, ccpA and codY deletion-mutant strains. We found that the global transcriptional regulatory protein CodY is required for the basal level of clhAB2 expression under all conditions tested, including the transition growth phase while CcpA, the major global carbon regulator, is needed for the high-level expression of clhAB2 in glucose-grown cells. © 2017 Huillet et al.

Few studies have examined the clinical features and visual outcome of optic neuritis (ON) within NMOSD in different racial populations. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics and long-term visual outcome of a Thai and an American-Caucasian cohort with NMOSD-related ON. Methods Medical records including brain and orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 16 consecutive subjects who developed visual loss due to ON as part of NMOSD evaluated at a single American tertiary referral center between 2006 and 2015 were reviewed and compared to those of 16 consecutive similar subjects evaluated at a single Thai tertiary referral center between 2010 and 2016. These cohorts represented the total number of NMOSD-related ON subjects seen during that time at those institutions. Statistical analyses were used for continuous and categorical data sets, and multiple regression analysis was used to adjust for differences in duration of follow-up and number of episodes of ON in each affected eye. Results All subjects within the Thai cohort were Asian, while the American cohort initially consisted of 14 Caucasian, 1 Asian and 1 African-American subject, but the latter two were excluded from analysis. In the Thai cohort, ON occurred in 21 eyes, with a total of 19 episodes, while in the American-Caucasian cohort ON occurred in 22 eyes, with a total of 21 episodes. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4)-antibody was positive in all subjects except for one American-Caucasian subject. The mean follow-up time was 17.8 (± 16.0) and 52.8 (± 51.9) months for the Thai and American-Caucasian populations, respectively. There was no difference between the two cohorts with respect to gender, age of NMOSD and NMOSD-related ON onset, initial clinical presentation of NMOSD, initial visual acuity and automated visual fields, prevalence of swollen optic disc in the acute phase, presence of pain on the affected side, mean time of onset of ON symptoms to MRI examination, distribution of segmental involvement of the anterior visual pathway abnormalities based on MRI findings, mean time of onset of ON symptoms to treatment, final visual acuity and automated visual fields. However, a higher proportion of Thai affected eyes were found to have an initial visual acuity of 20/200 or worse compared with the American-Caucasian cohort. Azathioprine was the most common maintenance treatment (75%) used among Thai subjects in contrast to rituximab (78.6%) among American-Caucasian subjects. Conclusion Despite the different prevalence among Thai and American-Caucasian populations, the clinical characteristics of ON in the NMOSD were very similar across these two populations, other than for more severe visual loss initially among Thai subjects. Notably, long-term visual outcome did not differ between these cohorts despite significant difference in the maintenance treatment regimen.

Nevertheless, the design of sustainable manufacturing processes is still ongoing. RESULTS: Sorbitol ester surfactants were synthesized by lipase-catalyzed esterification in solvent-free conditions. Octanoic acid was dispersed in a 70 wt% sorbitol aqueous solution (containing the enzyme). The maximal conversion of 23.5 mole % of esterified fatty acid per mole of loaded fatty acid was obtained after 48 h in optimal conditions. The performance of the reactor was affected by both the nature and amount of the reactants and the dispersion state. Detailed structural analysis demonstrated that lipase from Candida rugosa specifically catalyzed the acylation of sorbitol on primary hydroxyl groups. Sorbitol esters accumulated exclusively in the oil phase, which led to easy and efficient product recovery. Oil phase containing the sorbitol esters could be used directly for preparing oil-in-water nanoemulsion without adding any other stabilizer. These nanoemulsions exhibited good stability after 7 days storage at 25°C or 60°C. CONCLUSION: A green manufacturing process for food grade oil-in-water nanoemulsions was designed involving a lipase-catalyzed esterification step which produced in situ the required surfactant.

The excretory-secretory products (ES) that are excreted by infective larva play a significant role in host immune evasion and tissue destruction. To investigate the poorly understood mechanisms of G. spinigerum L3 pathogenesis, we focused on the potential effect of ES on inducing apoptosis in human immune cells by using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a model. Early and late apoptosis of PBMCs were assessed following the exposure of these cells to G. spinigerum L3 ES (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/ml) for 6–48 h. The apoptotic cells were identified by flow cytometric staining of PBMC with FITC-annexin V and propidium iodide. The expression of regulatory genes related to apoptosis mechanisms in ES-treated PBMCs was investigated using a Human Apoptosis RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array. The results showed significant levels of early phase apoptosis at 18 h and of late phase apoptosis at 24 h. We speculate that this apoptosis in PBMCs occurs via the extrinsic pathway. Apoptosis in the ES-induced PBMCs was observed as quickly as 90 min after exposure, and the highest effect was observed at 18–24 h. Furthermore, ES can trigger apoptosis lasting for 48 h. Our findings expand the understanding of one of the mechanisms involved, immune-evasive strategy mechanism used by G. spinigerum larvae during human gnathostomiasis. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Annexin V/propidium iodide; Apoptosis; Apoptosis regulatory genes; Excretory-secretory; Gnathostoma spinigerum; Immune evasion,"apoptosis; Article; controlled study; flow cytometry; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene control; gene expression; Gnathostoma spinigerum; gnathostomiasis; human; human cell; larval stage; microarray kit; nonhuman; pathogenesis; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; regulator gene; animal; apoptosis; cytology; genetics; Gnathostoma; gnathostomiasis; growth, development and aging; larva; metabolism; mononuclear cell; parasitology; pathophysiology; helminth protein; Animals; Apoptosis; Gnathostoma; Gnathostomiasis; Helminth Proteins; Humans; Larva; Leukocytes, Mononuclear",Article

The production of these useful compounds is controlled by a signaling cascade mediated by the γ-butyrolactone autoregulator IM-2. Previously we revealed that the far regulatory island includes the IM-2 receptor, the IM-2 biosynthetic enzyme, and several transcriptional regulators, and that it contributes to the regulation of indigoidine production in response to the signaling molecule. Here, we found that the vicinity of the far regulatory island includes the putative gene cluster for the biosynthesis of indigoidine and unidentified compounds, and demonstrated that the expression of the gene cluster is under the control of the IM-2 regulatory system. Heterologous expression of lbpA, encoding a plausible nonribosomal peptide synthetase, in the versatile model host Streptomyces avermitilis SUKA22 led to indigoidine production, which was enhanced dramatically by feeding of the indigoidine precursor L-glutamine.

To elucidate the putative features distinguishing these from epithelial rest of Malassez (ERM), we characterized hEPLCs based on cell lineage markers and tight junction protein expression. The aim of this study was, therefore, to establish and characterize hEPLCs lines from PDL tissues. The hEPLCs were isolated from PDL of third molar teeth. Cellular morphology and cell organelles were observed thoroughly. The characteristics of epithelial–endothelial-mesenchymal-like cells were compared in several markers by gene expression and immunofluorescence, to ERM and human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The resistance between cellular junctions was assessed by transepithelial electron resistance, and inflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA after infecting hEPLCs with periodontopathic bacteria. The hEPLCs developed into small epithelial-like cells in pavement appearance similar to ERM. However, gene expression patterns and immunofluorescence results were different from ERM and HUVECs, especially in tight junction markers (Claudin, ZO-1, and Occludins), and endothelial markers (vWF, CD34). The transepithelial electron resistance indicated higher resistance in hEPLCs, as compared to ERM. Periodontopathic bacteria were phagocytosed with upregulation of inflammatory cytokine secretion within 24 h. In conclusion, hEPLCs that were derived using the single cell isolation method formed tight multilayers colonies, as well as strongly expressed tight junction markers in gene expression and immunofluorescence. Novel hEPLCs lines exhibited differently from ERM, which might provide some specific functions such as metabolic exchange and defense mechanism against bacterial invasion in periodontal tissue. © 2017, The Author(s).",EMT; Epithelial rests of Malassez differentiation; Epithelial-like cells; Establishment cell lines; Periodontal ligament tissue,"CD34 antigen; cell adhesion molecule; claudin; occludin; protein ZO1; von Willebrand factor; autacoid; cytokine; adult; Article; cell adhesion; cell isolation; cell junction; cell lineage; cell organelle; cell structure; clinical article; controlled study; cytokine release; electric resistance; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epithelioid cell; female; human; human tissue; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; karyotyping; molar tooth; periodontal ligament; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; transmission electron microscopy; umbilical vein endothelial cell; upregulation; cell differentiation; cell line; cell separation; cytology; epithelium cell; gene expression; genetics; impedance; metabolism; microbiology; periodontal ligament; procedures; third molar; tight junction; ultrastructure; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Cell Separation; Cytokines; Electric Impedance; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Molar, Third; Organelles; Periodontal Ligament; Tight Junctions",Article

The results showed that compound 4b exhibited good anti-Aβ aggregation (IC50 = 4.78 µM) and antioxidant activity (IC50 = 41.22 µM) and moderate anti-BACE1 inhibitory activity (23.70% at 50 µM), and could be a lead compound. Moreover, this compound showed no neurotoxicity along with a greater ability to inhibit oxidative stress on P19-derived neuronal cells (50.59% cell viability at 1 nM). The neuritogenic activity presented more branching numbers (9.33) and longer neurites (109.74 µm) than the control, and was comparable to the quercetin positive control. Taken together, these results suggest compound 4b had the greatest multifunctional activities and might be a very promising lead compound for the further development of drugs for AD. © 2017, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan.",Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation; Neuritogencity; Neuroprotective; Prenylated resveratrol derivatives; β-Secretase (BACE1),"3 ethoxy 4',5 hydroxystilbene; 3 methoxy 4',5 hydroxystilbene; 3,4' diethoxy 5 hydroxystilbene; 3,4' dimethoxy 5 hydroxystilbene; 3,5,4' tri(methoxymethoxy) 4 prenylstilbene; 3,5,4' tri(methoxymethoxy)stilbene; 3,5,4' triethoxystilbene; 3,5,4' trihydroxy 2 geranylstilbene; 3,5,4' trihydroxy 2 prenylstilbene; 3,5,4' trihydroxy 2,6 geranylstilbene; 3,5,4' trihydroxy 2,6 prenylstilbene; 3,5,4' trihydroxy 4 geranylstilbene; 3,5,4' trihydroxy 4 prenylstilbene; 3,5,4' trimethoxystilbene; 4' ethoxy 3,5 dihydroxystilbene; 4' methoxy 3,5 dihydroxystilbene; ascorbic acid; beta secretase; beta secretase inhibitor; calbiochem; curcumin; quercetin; resveratrol; unclassified drug; amyloid beta protein; antioxidant; neuroprotective agent; plant extract; resveratrol; secretase; stilbene derivative; Alzheimer disease; animal cell; antioxidant activity; Article; cell viability; cell viability assay; controlled study; drug structure; drug synthesis; embryo; IC50; molecular docking; mouse; nerve cell; nerve cell differentiation; neurite; neuroprotection; nonhuman; oxidative stress; P19 cell line; Alzheimer disease; antagonists and inhibitors; cell culture technique; drug effects; human; metabolism; prenylation; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Antioxidants; Cell Culture Techniques; Humans; Neurites; Neurons; Neuroprotective Agents; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Prenylation; Stilbenes",Article

Eighty-two autistic subjects diagnosed with DSM-IV and who were treated with risperidone for more than 1 year were recruited. Pharmacogenomics and clinical outcome (CGI-I, aggressive, overactivity and repetitive score) were evaluated. Almost all patients showed stable symptoms on aggressive behaviour (89.02%), overactivity (71.95%), repetitive (70.89%) behaviour and all clinical symptoms (81.71%). Only 4.48% of patients showed minimally worse CGI-I score. Patients in the non-stable symptom group had DRD2 Taq1A non-wild-type (TT and CT) frequencies higher than the clinically stable group (p = 0.04), whereas other gene polymorphisms showed no significant association. Haplotype ACCTCAT (rs6311, rs1045642, rs1128503, rs1800497, rs4436578, rs1799978, rs6280) showed a significant association with non-stable clinical outcome (χ2 = 6.642, p = 0.010). Risperidone levels showed no association with any clinical outcome. On the other hand, risperidone dose, 9-OH risperidone levels and prolactin levels were significantly higher in the non-stable compared to the stable symptom group (p = 0.013, p = 0.044, p = 0.030). Increased appetite was the most common adverse drug reaction and associated with higher body-weight, whereas it was not significantly associated with genetic variations and non-genetic information. In conclusion, risperidone showed efficacy to control autism, especially aggressive symptoms in long-term treatment.

To improve the message dissemination in these networks, we show the need to study the graph-theoretic properties of VANETs, since they neither follow the small-world nor the scale-free network characteristics often found in large self-organized networks. We consider three fundamental properties: connectivity, node degree, and clustering coefficient. For each property, we develop and validate analytical models for both the urban and highway scenarios, building an extensive graph structure perspective on VANETs. With this, we see how connectivity changes with network density, that VANETs exhibit truncated Gaussian node degree distributions, and that network clustering coefficients do not depend on the network’s size or density. We then show how these results can be used to generate individual behavior favorable to the whole network using local information. The usefulness of this new approach is demonstrated by proposing new mechanisms to enhance the urban vehicular broadcasting protocol UV-CAST. Our results show that these new mechanisms lead to excellent performance while reducing the overhead in the UV-CAST protocol. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Protocol architecture; Routing protocols; Wireless communications,Ad hoc networks; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Information dissemination; Internet; Large scale systems; Network architecture; Routing protocols; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Broadcasting protocols; Clustering coefficient; Network clustering coefficients; Node degree distribution; Protocol architecture; Self-organized networks; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Wireless communications; Vehicular ad hoc networks,Article

PIH is one of the most common complications of procedures performed using laser and other light sources. The severity of PIH is determined by the inherent skin color, degree and depth of inflammation, degree of dermoepidermal junction disruption, inflammatory conditions, and the stability of melanocytes, leading to epidermal and dermal melanin pigment deposition. The depth of melanin pigment is the key factor to predict prognosis and treatment outcome. Epidermal hyperpigmentation fades more rapidly than dermal hyperpigmentation. Various inflammatory disorders can eventually result in PIH. The evaluation of pigmentation using noninvasive tools helps define the level of pigmentation in the skin, pigmentation intensity, and guides therapeutic approaches.

However, the worldwide emergence of CV-A6 infection in HFMD necessitates development of an improved multiplex rRT-PCR method. To rapidly determine the etiology of HFMD, two rRT-PCR assays using TaqMan probes were developed to differentiate among three selected common enteroviruses (EV-A71, CV-A16 and CV-A6) and to enable broad detection of enteroviruses (pan-enterovirus assay). No cross-reactions were observed with other RNA viruses examined. The detection limits of both assays were 10 copies per microliter for EV-A71, CV-A6 and CV-A16, and pan-enterovirus. The methods showed high accuracy (EV-A71, 90.6%; CV-A6, 92.0%; CV-A16, 100%), sensitivity (EV-A71, 96.5%; CV-A6, 95.8%; CV-A16, 99.0%), and specificity (EV-A71, 100%; CV-A6, 99.9%; CV-A16, 99.9%) in testing clinical specimens (n = 1049) during 2014–2016, superior to those of conventional RT-PCR.

Creating new products based on attributes selected from preference maps that use those clusters may result in product failure because the products are developed for consumers with some dissimilar preferences. Methods for clustering that produce more homogeneous clusters of consumers have been reported, that is, SPC with additional “manual” clustering used for gathering consumers with congruent liking of products. In this study, internal and external preference maps were created using two supplemental “manual” clustering approaches and are compared with maps from hierarchical and partitional clustering (i.e., k-means) results. We observe how clusters with higher homogeneity in product liking patterns change spaces of consumers, descriptors, and product co-ordinates in internal and external preference maps. Improvement in the preference mapping was exhibited, but the homogenous consumer clusters still miscommunicate some information, as the maps usually do. This was especially true for external preference maps with low percentage variance explained in the descriptors. Thus, it is essential to compare mapping results to the original data and to findings from the original descriptive study to gain the most appropriate information. Practical applications: Correctness of sensory information is very important for further analysis. The methods using some additional clustering procedures yield more exactitude in consumer liking patterns than only statistical package clustering. Statistical package clustering with supplementary manual clustering ensures that consumers who share both the most liked product and the least liked products are placed in same in the cluster. However, that does not ensure that the “maps” generated allow for unqualified interpretation. It is essential that preference mapping procedure are joined with common sense reviewing of the original data, key descriptive findings, and key information on most and least liked products within various consumer groups. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Cluster analysis; Mapping; Clustering approach; Clustering procedure; Descriptive studies; Homogeneous cluster; Partitional clustering; Preference mappings; Sensory information; Statistical packages; Sensory analysis,Article

The clinical course of PIH is chronic and unpredictable, although the probability of resolution of epidermal hyperpigmentation is better than those of dermal hyperpigmentation. PIH can be prevented or alleviated. When it does occur, the underlying inflammatory conditions should be sought and treated as the first step to reduce the progression of inflammation and PIH (which is an inflammatory consequence). If the inflammatory conditions subsides or there is no evidence of inflammation at the time of diagnosis, the treatments of PIH should be considered as the next step. Understanding the available treatment options helps the physician choose the appropriate treatment for each patient. Having a reproducible model for PIH is essential for the development of treatment modalities.

MPs have the great advantage of easy manipulation using a magnet. In nucleic acid detection, these particles can act as a capture support for rapid and simple biomolecule separation. The surfaces of MPs can be modified by coating with various polymer materials to provide functionalization for different applications. The use of MPs enhances the sensitivity and specificity of detection due to the specific activity on the surface of the particles. Practical applications of MPs demonstrate greater efficiency than conventional methods. Beyond traditional detection, MPs have been successfully adopted as a smart carrier in microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip biosensors. The versatility of MPs has enabled their integration into small single detection units. MPs-based biosensors can facilitate rapid and highly sensitive detection of very small amounts of a sample.

Surgery is the only curative treatment, while adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy render poor responses. Cell-based immunotherapy is a potential strategy for cholangiocarcinoma treatment. However, variation of tumor antigens in cholangiocarcinoma leads to the ineffectiveness of cell-based immunotherapy. In this study, we examined the activation of effector T-cells by dendritic cells pulsed with protein lysate or total RNA from cholangiocarcinoma cell lines for their cytolytic activity against cholangiocarcinoma. Broad-spectrum antigen types with respect to RNA antigen sources were obtained from combination of three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (KKU-213, KKU-100, and KKU-055). Compared with protein lysate–pulsed dendritic cells, total RNA–pulsed dendritic cells induced anti-tumor effector T-cell response with higher killing ability to KKU-100 and KKU-213 cells compared with protein lysate–pulsed dendritic cells. Moreover, pooled messenger RNA from three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines significantly increased the specific killing capacity of activated lymphocytes against KKU-213 cells. These results suggest that activation of anti-tumor effector T-cells against cholangiocarcinoma by RNA-pulsed dendritic cells is more effective than that by protein lysate–pulsed dendritic cells.

Typically, this is a biological treatment process under anaerobic condition, which results in unsatisfactory effluent quality. Effluent or liquid from cesspool system normally seeps into surrounding soil in turn causes groundwater contamination. In this modification, blackwater was treated by a series of upflow sludge tank, photobioreactor and cesspool tank. In the photobioreactor, symbiotic relationship between algae and bacteria was found under aerobic condition, in which the oxygen produced was consumed by bacteria to degrade organics and others. The modified system could achieve much higher removal efficiency than the existing cesspool or the septic tank. In the series of upflow sludge tank and photobioreactor tank of lab-scale experiments with the 2 d of hydraulic retention time, the average effluent chemical oxygen demand concentration was about 120 mg/L, which could possibly meet the effluent standard of Thailand. The flushing effect should be considered for the application in realistic condition. This modification system could be a promising low-cost technology to enhance treatment performance of cesspool system. © 2017 Desalination Publications.

Methods: We searched published studies indexed in MEDLINE and EMBASE database from inception to December 2015. Studies that reported odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios, hazard ratios or standardized incidence ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing the risk of NAFLD among participants who had insomnia or EDS versus those without insomnia or EDS were included. Pooled ORs and 95% CI were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic were used to determine the between-study heterogeneity. Results: Our search strategy yielded 2117 potentially relevant articles (781 articles from MEDLINE and 1336 articles from EMBASE). After comprehensive review, seven studies (three cross-sectional studies and four case-control studies) were found to be eligible and were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of NAFLD in participants who had insomnia was significantly higher with the pooled OR of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00-1.27). The statistical heterogeneity was moderate with an I2 of 62%. Elevated risk of NAFLD was also observed among participants with EDS even though the 95% CI was wider and did not reach statistical significance (pooled OR 2.21; 95% CI, 0.84-5.82). The statistical heterogeneity was moderate with an I2 of 62%. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated an increased risk of NAFLD among participants who had insomnia or EDS.

We examined the genetic diversity of this parasite by analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the P. vivax rhomboid-like protease 1 gene (Pvrom1) in parasites collected from western (Tak province, Thai-Myanmar border) and eastern (Chanthaburi province, Thai-Cambodia border) regions. Methods Data were collected by a cross-sectional survey, consisting of 47 and 45 P. vivax-infected filter paper-spotted blood samples from the western and eastern regions of Thailand, respectively during September 2013 to May 2014. Extracted DNA was examined for presence of P. vivax using Plasmodium species-specific nested PCR. Pvrom1 gene was PCR amplified, sequenced and the SNP diversity was analyzed using F-STAT, DnaSP, MEGA and LIAN programs. Results Comparison of sequences of the 92 Pvrom1 831-base open reading frames with that of a reference sequence (GenBank acc. no. XM001615211) revealed 17 samples with a total of 8 polymorphic sites, consisting of singleton (exon 3, nt 645) and parsimony informative (exon 1, nt 22 and 39; exon 3, nt 336, 537 and 656; and exon 4, nt 719 and 748) sites, which resulted in six different deduced Pvrom1 variants. Non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions ratio estimated by the DnaSP program was 1.65 indicating positive selection, but the Z-tests of selection showed no significant deviations from neutrality for Pvrom1 samples from western region of Thailand. In addition McDonald Kreitman test (MK) showed not significant, and Fst values are not different between the two regions and the regions combined. Interestingly, only Pvrom1 exon 2 was the most conserved sequences among the four exons. Conclusions The relatively high degree of Pvrom1 polymorphism suggests that the protein is important for parasite survival in face of changes in both insect vector and human populations. These polymorphisms could serve as a sensitive marker for studying plasmodial genetic diversity. The significance of Pvrom1 conserved exon 2 sequence remains to be investigated. © 2017 Mahidol University",Genetic diversity; Plasmodium vivax; Polymorphism; Rhomboid-like protease 1,"Article; controlled study; gene; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene sequence; genetic variability; microscopy; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; parasite isolation; parsimony analysis; Plasmodium vivax; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Pvrom1 gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; Thailand; animal; chemistry; cross-sectional study; enzymology; exon; genetics; human; insect vector; isolation and purification; parasitology; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; single nucleotide polymorphism; species difference; peptide hydrolase; protozoal DNA; protozoal protein; Animals; Base Sequence; Cross-Sectional Studies; DNA, Protozoan; Exons; Humans; Insect Vectors; Linkage Disequilibrium; Malaria, Vivax; Open Reading Frames; Peptide Hydrolases; Plasmodium vivax; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Protozoan Proteins; Species Specificity; Thailand",Article

This cross-sectional study assessed the validity and acceptability of the EPDS in Karen and Burmese among postpartum migrant and refugee women on the Thai–Myanmar border. The EPDS was administered to participants and results compared with a diagnostic interview. Local staff provided feedback on the acceptability of the EPDS through a focus group discussion. Results from 670 women showed high accuracy and reasonable internal consistency of the EPDS. However, acceptability to local staff was low, limiting the utility of the EPDS in this setting despite its good psychometrics.

Currently, there is no effective therapy for ADPKD. Recent studies report PC1 regulates CFTR chloride channels and β-catenin levels in normal renal epithelial cells. Concurrently, our previous study found steviol retarded renal cyst enlargement in an in vitro and in an in vivo models by reducing CFTR expression and activity. Therefore, a potential relationship between steviol and PC1 is worthy of exploration. The present study was aimed to determine the effect of steviol on PC1, CFTR, and β-catenin levels in renal epithelial cells with defective PC1 biogenesis and expression (Prkcsh−/− cell) and postnatal Pkd1 homozygous cell (Pkd1−/− cells). Using western blot analysis, it was found that steviol treatment at 100 μM for 24–48 h substantially enhanced and stabilized PC1 C-terminal expression, while decreasing CFTR and β-catenin protein expression in both Prkcsh−/− and Pkd1−/− cells. In addition, steviol promoted LAMP2 expression, a lysosomal enzyme marker. Interestingly, hydroxychloroquine (a lysosome inhibitor) treatment abolished steviol's effect in reducing CFTR and β-catenin protein expression. Taken together, these findings suggest steviol slows cyst progression in cells and animal models of PKD, in part, by enhancing and stabilizing PC1 protein expression as well as by promoting lysosomal degradation of CFTR and β-catenin. Therefore, steviol may represent a promising compound for treatment of polycystic kidney disease. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",CFTR: Prkcsh−/− cell; Polycystin 1: β-catenin; Steviol,beta catenin; cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; hydroxychloroquine; lysosome associated membrane protein 2; polycystin 1; steviol; animal cell; Article; controlled study; drug mechanism; epithelium cell; immunoblotting; kidney epithelium; lysosome; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; Western blotting,Article

Methods: Comprehensive literature review was conducted utilizing MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through April 2017 to identify all studies that investigated the risks of CKD or ESRD in patients taking PPIs/H2RAs versus those without PPIs/H2RAs. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. The protocol for this study is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42017067252). Results: Five studies with 536,902 participants were patients were identified and included in the data analysis. When compared with non-PPIs users, the pooled risk ratio (RR) of CKD or ESRD in patients with PPI use was 1.33 (95% CI 1.18–1.51). Pre-specified subgroup analysis (stratified by CKD or ESRD status) demonstrated pooled RRs of 1.22 (95% CI 1.14–1.30) for association between PPI use and CKD and 1.88 (95% CI 1.71–2.06) for association between PPI use and ESRD, respectively. However, there was no association between the use of H2RAs and CKD with a pooled RR of 1.02 (95% CI 0.83–1.25). When compared with the use of H2RAs, the pooled RR of CKD in patients with PPI use was 1.29 (95% CI 1.22–1.36).

Influences of various PTA contents and different structures of the copolymers on molecular characteristics, ENX encapsulation, particle characteristics, and capability of drug transport across Caco-2 cells were elucidated. The results showed that P(CatCLCL)2-PEG and P(CatCLCL)-mPEG copolymers self-aggregated and encapsulated ENX into spherical particles of ∼200–450 nm. The increasing amount of PTA on the copolymers increased encapsulation efficiency of over 90%. The ENX release from both types of the cationized copolymer particles was pH-dependent which was retarded at pH 1.2 and accelerated at pH 7.4, supporting the drug protection in the acidic environment and possible release in the blood circulation. The toxicity of ENX-loaded particles on Caco-2 cells decreased when decreasing the amount of PTA. The triblock and diblock particles dramatically enhanced ENX uptake and transport across Caco-2 cells as compared to the ENX solution. However, the different structures of the copolymers slightly affected ENX transport. These results suggested that P(CatCLCL)2-PEG and P(CatCLCL)-mPEG copolymers would be potential carriers for oral delivery of ENX. Statement of Significance The anionic drugs such as proteins, peptides or polysaccharides are generally administered via invasive route causing patient incompliance and high cost of hospitalization. The development of biomaterials for non-invasive delivery of those drugs has gained much attention, especially for oral delivery. However, they have limitation due to non-biocompatibility and poor drug bioavailability. In this study, the novel poly(ε-caprolactone)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers grafted with propargyltrimethyl ammonium iodide, a small cationic ligand, were introduced to use as a carrier for oral delivery of enoxaparin, a highly negatively charged drug. The study showed that these cationized copolymers could achieve high enoxaparin entrapment efficiency, protect drug release in an acidic environment and enhance enoxaparin permeability across Caco-2 cells, the intestinal cell model. These characteristics of the cationized copolymers make them a potential candidate for oral delivery of anionic drugs for biomaterial applications. © 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.",Cationic copolymer; Enoxaparin; Nanoparticles; Oral delivery; Poly(ε-carprolactone)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers; Polymer architecture,"copolymer; diblock poly(epsilon caprolactone); enoxaparin; macrogol; nanocarrier; polycaprolactone; triblock poly(epsilon caprolactone); unclassified drug; cation; enoxaparin; macrogol derivative; polycaprolactone-g-polyethylene glycol; polyester; Article; cell viability; confocal laser scanning microscopy; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug penetration; drug release; drug screening; drug uptake; in vitro study; nanoencapsulation; particle size; priority journal; surface charge; transmission electron microscopy; zeta potential; Caco-2 cell line; cell death; cell membrane permeability; chemistry; drug effects; human; oral drug administration; surface property; temperature; three dimensional imaging; Administration, Oral; Caco-2 Cells; Cations; Cell Death; Cell Membrane Permeability; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Enoxaparin; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Particle Size; Polyesters; Polyethylene Glycols; Surface Properties; Temperature",Article

When supplemented in feed, the developed strain should offer specific viral disease resistance and still remain other beneficial effects on shrimp health against other bacterial pathogens. The pWH1520 expression vector was constructed to encode hairpin RNA targeting shrimp yellow head virus (YHV) in L. plantarum. The quantity of YHV-specific dsRNA (dsYHV) was approximately 1.66 ± 0.25 ng from 7 × 1011 CFU of L. plantarum. Feeding shrimp with the probiotic expressing dsYHV (at 1011 CFU g−1 feed) for 5 days prior to YHV challenge provided shrimp partial protection against YHV. In vitro agar well diffusion analysis revealed that both wild-type and transformed L. plantarum inhibited growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the shrimp pathogen responsible for acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) and early mortality syndrome (EMS). When tested in shrimp by immersion method, both L. plantarum strains (at 107 CFUs ml−1 seawater) also provided shrimp protection against V. parahaemolyticus. In conclusion, this study suggested the potential of the dsRNA-expressed L. plantarum for promoting shrimp health against the pathogenic virus. In addition, engineering L. plantarum for dsRNA production did not alter the probiotic’s intrinsic antibacterial property, and therefore, the developed strain can be used to protect shrimp against the important bacterial pathogen, V. parahaemolyticus causing AHPND/EMS. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Double-stranded RNA; Lactobacillus plantarum; Shrimp disease; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Yellow head virus,antimicrobial activity; bacterium; disease control; inhibition; mortality; pathogen; probiotics; RNA; shrimp culture; Bacteria (microorganisms); Decapoda (Crustacea); Lactobacillus plantarum; Penaeidae; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Yellow head virus,Article

Migraine, particularly with aura, has been associated with ocular and systemic ischemic complications, but there are limited data on the ocular vasculature in migraine. We used optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to assess perfusion of the macula and optic nerve in migraine patients, with (MA) and without (MO) aura, compared to healthy controls (HC). METHODS. We recruited 15 MA (mean age 42 years), 12 MO (mean age 46 years), and 22 HC (mean age 39 years) participants from neurology and neuro-ophthalmology clinics. Participants underwent optical coherence tomography and 3 × 3 mm OCTA of the macula and optic nerve. Foveal avascular zone area was automatically measured using AngioVue software, and vessel density was calculated as blood vessel length divided by scan area (mm-1) after skeletonization of OCTA images. RESULTS. On macular OCTA, MA participants had an enlarged foveal avascular zone area when compared with HC (0.300 ± 0.019 vs. 0.220 ± 0.066 mm2, P = 0.006). In addition, superficial foveal vessel density was decreased in MA participants when compared with MO participants (7.8 ± 0.31 vs. 9.3 ± 0.44, P = 0.04) and HC (7.8 ± 0.31 vs. 9.4 ± 0.21 mm-1, P = 0.002). On optic nerve OCTA, the MA participants had reduced superior peripapillary vessel density when compared with the MO participants (12.0 ± 0.45 vs. 14.0 ± 0.38 mm-1, P = 0.031) and HC (12.0 ± 0.45 vs. 14.1 ± 0.53 mm-1, P = 0.035). There were no significant differences between the MO and HC groups. CONCLUSIONS. Migraine with, but not without, aura was associated with foveal and peripapillary vascular decrements, which may possibly mediate increased risk of ocular and systemic vascular complications in these patients. OCTA could potentially be useful as a biomarker for migraine with aura. © 2017 The Authors.",Migraine; Neuro-ophthalmology; OCT angiography,"adult; Article; capillary; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; migraine; migraine aura; optical coherence tomography angiography; priority journal; retina fovea; retina macula lutea; scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; slit lamp microscopy; adolescent; comparative study; computed tomographic angiography; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; migraine with aura; migraine without aura; normal human; optic disk; optical coherence tomography; pathophysiology; procedures; vascularization; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Computed Tomography Angiography; Female; Fovea Centralis; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Migraine with Aura; Migraine without Aura; Optic Disk; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Young Adult",Article

None of tools have been developed specifically for high-risk patients. This study aimed to develop a simple risk scoring to predict NAFLD in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: A total of 509 patients with MetS were recruited. All were diagnosed by clinicians with ultrasonography-confirmed whether they were patients with NAFLD. Patients were randomly divided into derivation (n=400) and validation (n=109) cohort. To develop the risk score, clinical risk indicators measured at the time of recruitment were built by logistic regression. Regression coefficients were transformed into item scores and added up to a total score. A risk scoring scheme was developed from clinical predictors: BMI ≥25, AST/ALT ≥1, ALT ≥40, type 2 diabetes mellitus and central obesity. The scoring scheme was applied in validation cohort to test the performance. Results: The scheme explained, by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AuROC), 76.8% of being NAFLD with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2=4.35; P=.629). The positive likelihood ratio of NAFLD in patients with low risk (scores below 3) and high risk (scores 5 and over) were 2.32 (95% CI: 1.90-2.82) and 7.77 (95% CI: 2.47-24.47) respectively. When applied in validation cohort, the score showed good performance with AuROC 76.7%, and illustrated 84%, and 100% certainty in low- and high-risk groups respectively. Conclusions: A simple and non-invasive scoring scheme of five predictors provides good prediction indices for NAFLD in MetS patients. This scheme may help clinicians in order to take further appropriate action. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This paper explores evolving situation recognition using photo streams coming from disparate sources combined with the advances of deep learning. Using visual concepts in photos together with space and time information, we formulate the situation detection into a semi-supervised learning framework and propose new graph-based models to solve the problem. To extend the method for unknown situations, we introduce a soft label method that enables the traditional semi-supervised learning framework to accurately predict predefined labels as well as effectively form new clusters. To overcome the noisy data which degrades graph quality, leading to poor recognition results, we take advantage of two kinds of noise-robust norms which can eliminate the adverse effects of outliers in visual concepts and improve the accuracy of situation recognition.

This study investigated whether KJ could promote cisplatin- and paclitaxel (PTX)-induced cancer cell death in drug-resistance human ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3). Cytotoxicity testing showed that SKOV3 was more resistant to cisplatin and PTX compared to drug-sensitive human ovarian cancer cells (A2780). The cytotoxicity of PTX was significantly increased in SKOV3 cells when co-treated with KJ. We found that enhancement of PTX toxicity in the cells was not related to P-gp inhibition. To elucidate the mechanism by which KJ increases PTX sensitivity, the expression of cell death involving proteins was analyzed by Western blot analysis. The results showed that PTX treatment increased the level of an anti-apoptotic protein, survivin, which may be involved in drug resistance in SKOV3. The co-treatment with PTX and KJ dramatically decreased the level of survivin and markedly induced cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, which are apoptotic-induced molecules. These findings may support the use of KJ as an effective chemosensitizer in combination with conventional chemotherapy to promote PTX sensitization in ovarian cancer patients. © 2017, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan KK.",Adjuvant therapy; Bitter melon; Chemotherapy; Drug resistance; Kuguacin J; Ovarian cancer,"antineoplastic agent; caspase 3; cisplatin; kuguacin J; multidrug resistance protein; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; paclitaxel; plant medicinal product; survivin; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; kuguacin J; paclitaxel; triterpene; A2780 cell line; adult; animal experiment; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer resistance; cell cycle arrest; controlled study; DNA damage; Drosophila melanogaster; drug cytotoxicity; drug isolation; drug potentiation; drug structure; genomic instability; human; human cell; Momordica charantia; nonhuman; ovarian cancer cell line; plant leaf; SK-OV-3 cell line; chemistry; drug resistance; female; ovary tumor; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Humans; Momordica charantia; Ovarian Neoplasms; Paclitaxel; Plant Leaves; Triterpenes",Article

The goal of this study is to determine the optimal imaging protocols and parameters using a realistic simulation study. The time activity curves (TACs) of different tissue organs from a 30-s infusion time (IT) of 18F-flurpiridaz in a dynamic PET study were extracted from a previous study. The TACs at different time points were incorporated in a series of realistic 3D XCAT phantoms from which the parameters of a 2-compartment model and the ‘true’ MBF of 18F-flurpiridaz were determined. The compartmental model was used to generate TACs from 7 additional ITs. PET projection data from the XCAT phantoms were generated using Monte Carlo simulation. They were reconstructed using an OS-EM reconstruction algorithm with different update number (N) to obtain dynamic PET images. The blood and myocardial TACs were derived from the dynamic images from which the MBF and %MBF error was estimated. The %MBF error decreases with increasing N of the OS-EM and levels off after ∼42. The 30-s IT gave the smallest %MBF error that decreases from ∼0.57% to ∼19.40%. The MBF for 2-min, 4-min, 8-min and 16-min IT were statistically significant different from the MBF for 30-s IT (P &lt; 0.05). Too fast or too slow infusion time gave higher %MBF error.

To identify and quantify the three distinct retinal capillary plexuses and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in healthy subjects according to age using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) with novel projection artifact removal (PAR) software and improved segmentation. METHODS. All eyes in this cross-sectional study underwent OCTA imaging using RTVue XR Avanti with novel PAR AngioVue software. OCTA scans were analyzed and the three main parafoveal retinal capillary plexuses were segmented and vessel density and FAZ area were calculated. RESULTS. A total of 152 normal eyes from 95 subjects (39 males, 56 females, mean age 42±25 years) were included. The mean vessel density was 15.48±2.04 mm-1 in the superficial retinal capillary plexus (SCP), 15.28±1.82 mm-1 in the intermediate retinal capillary plexus (ICP), and 16.33±2.32 mm-1 in the deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP) for 3 3 3-mm OCTA images. Analysis of 3 3 3-mm scans yielded a mean FAZ area of 0.270±0.101 mm2. The average reduction in vessel density per year of age with 3 3 3-mm OCTA scans was 0.04 mm-1 (0.22%) in the SCP, 0.05 mm-1 (0.27%) in the ICP, and 0.06 mm-1 (0.30%) in the DCP. The average increase in FAZ area per year of age was 0.0015 mm2 (0.72%). CONCLUSIONS.

Key international legal instruments governing pandemic management in the European Union (EU): the International Health Regulations (2005) and Decision 1082/13 require EU Member States to develop national plans and invite them to establish national legal frameworks to support compliance with this international legislation. Although Member States may design the legal framework as they choose, the strongest instrument of pandemic governance is national legislation. It is currently unclear what national pandemic governance exists in Member States as it has not been mapped, i.e. identified and collated. Legal analysis and empirical evaluation of implementation and impact have therefore not been possible. We propose comprehensive mapping to create the necessary comparative data for legal analysis assessing national legislation's compliance with international obligations and ethical principles. Empirical research could evaluate its effectiveness in promoting cross-border coherence and robust emergency response. We draw on the U.S. experience with “policy surveillance”, the systematic scientific mapping of laws of public health importance. Until national pandemic governance is mapped and evaluated, we cannot know if it is lawful, ethical or effective. © 2017 The Authors",,Article; emergency health service; ethics; European Union; government regulation; health care planning; international law; law; legal aspect; pandemic; public health service; public policy,Article

The thus far “incurable” stigma for AD prevails because of variations in the success rates of different treatment protocols in animal and human studies. Among the classical hypotheses explaining AD pathogenesis, the amyloid hypothesis is currently being targeted for drug development. The underlying concept is to prevent the formation of these neurotoxic peptides which play a central role in AD pathology and trigger a multispectral cascade of neurodegenerative processes post-aggregation. This could possibly be achieved by pharmacological inhibition of β-or γ-secretase or stimulating the nonamyloidogenic α-secretase. Melatonin the pineal hormone is a multifunctioning indoleamine. Production of this amphiphilic molecule diminishes with advancing age and this decrease runs parallel with the progression of AD which itself explains the potential benefits of melatonin in line of development and devastating consequences of the disease progression. Our recent studies have revealed a novel mechanism by which melatonin stimulates the nonamyloidogenic processing and inhibits the amyloidogenic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) by stimulating α-secretases and consequently down regulating both β-and γ-secretases at the transcriptional level. In this review, we discuss and evaluate the neuroprotective functions of melatonin in AD pathogenesis, including its role in the classical hypotheses in cellular and animal models and clinical interventions in AD patients, and suggest that with early detection, melatonin treatment is qualified to be an anti-AD therapy. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.",Aging; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-β peptide; Melatonin; Neuroprotection; Secretases,alpha secretase; amyloid; amyloid beta protein; amyloid precursor protein; beta secretase; calcium; cholesterol; gamma secretase; insulin; melatonin; tau protein; aging; Alzheimer disease; cholinergic system; drug efficacy; enzyme inhibition; epigenetics; genetic improvement; homeostasis; human; life extension; longevity; mitochondrial dynamics; nervous system development; nervous system inflammation; neuroprotection; nonhuman; Review; senescence; sex difference; signal transduction; transcription regulation,Review

Suboptimal complementary feeding practices are a main risk factor for stunting.

This paper describes five tools, namely, ProPAN, Optifood, Cost of the Diet, Fill the Nutrient Gap, and Monitoring Results for Equity System that can be used in different combinations to improve situation analysis, planning, implementation, monitoring, or evaluation approaches for complementary feeding in a particular context. ProPAN helps with development of strategies and activities designed to change the behaviours of the target population. Optifood provides guidance for developing food-based recommendations. The Cost of the Diet can provide insight on economic barriers to accessing a nutritious and balanced diet. The Fill the Nutrient Gap facilitates formulation of context-specific policies and programmatic approaches to improve nutrient intake, through a multistakeholder process that uses insights from linear programming and secondary data. The Monitoring Results for Equity System helps with analysis of gaps, constraints, and determinants of complementary feeding interventions and adoption of recommended practices especially in the most vulnerable and deprived populations.

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States","With the rapidly increasing abundance and accessibility of genomic data, there is a growing interest in using population genetic approaches to characterize fine-scale dispersal of organisms, providing insight into biological processes across a broad range of fields including ecology, evolution and epidemiology. For sexually recombining haploid organisms such as the human malaria parasite P. falciparum, however, there have been no systematic assessments of the type of data and methods required to resolve fine scale connectivity. This analytical gap hinders the use of genomics for understanding local transmission patterns, a crucial goal for policy makers charged with eliminating this important human pathogen. Here we use data collected from four clinics with a catchment area spanning approximately 120 km of the Thai-Myanmar border to compare the ability of divergence (FST) and relatedness based on identity by descent (IBD) to resolve spatial connectivity between malaria parasites collected from proximal clinics. We found no relationship between inter-clinic distance and FST, likely due to sampling of highly related parasites within clinics, but a significant decline in IBD-based relatedness with increasing inter-clinic distance. This association was contingent upon the data set type and size. We estimated that approximately 147 single-infection whole genome sequenced parasite samples or 222 single-infection parasite samples genotyped at 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were sufficient to recover a robust spatial trend estimate at this scale. In summary, surveillance efforts cannot rely on classical measures of genetic divergence to measure P. falciparum transmission on a local scale. Given adequate sampling, IBD-based relatedness provides a useful alternative, and robust trends can be obtained from parasite samples genotyped at approximately 100 SNPs. © 2017 Taylor et al.",,"Article; controlled study; disease transmission; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; human; human cell; limit of quantitation; longitudinal study; malaria falciparum; Myanmar; nonhuman; Plasmodium falciparum; population size; single nucleotide polymorphism; trend study; genetics; genome; haplotype; malaria falciparum; parasitology; Thailand; protozoal DNA; DNA, Protozoan; Genome, Protozoan; Haplotypes; Humans; Malaria, Falciparum; Plasmodium falciparum; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Thailand",Article

Here, we report the identification and characterization of hexahydroquinolines (HHQs) that show low nanomolar potency against both pathogenic and transmissible intra-erythrocytic forms of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This activity translates into potent transmission-blocking potential, as shown by in vitro male gamete formation assays and reduced oocyst infection and prevalence in Anopheles mosquitoes. In vivo studies illustrated the ability of lead HHQs to suppress Plasmodium berghei blood-stage parasite proliferation. Resistance selection studies, confirmed by CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing, identified the digestive vacuole membrane-spanning transporter PfMDR1 (P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene-1) as a determinant of parasite resistance to HHQs. Haemoglobin and haem fractionation assays suggest a mode of action that results in reduced haemozoin levels and might involve inhibition of host haemoglobin uptake into intra-erythrocytic parasites. Furthermore, parasites resistant to HHQs displayed increased susceptibility to several first-line antimalarial drugs, including lumefantrine, confirming that HHQs have a different mode of action to other antimalarials drugs for which PfMDR1 is known to confer resistance. This work evokes therapeutic strategies that combine opposing selective pressures on this parasite transporter as an approach to countering the emergence and transmission of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum malaria. © 2017 The Author(s).",,antimalarial agent; benflumetol; CRISPR associated protein; hemoglobin; hemozoin; hexahydroquinoline derivative; quinoline derivative; unclassified drug; Anopheles; antimalarial activity; antimalarial drug resistance; antimalarial drug susceptibility; Article; controlled study; drug identification; drug potency; drug screening; fractionation; gamete; gene; gene editing; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; nonhuman; oocyst; parasite development; pfmdr1 gene; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal,Article

Plasmodium falciparum infections may reduce maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency, but mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: Mother-cord paired serum samples collected at delivery from Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Thailand-Myanmar Border Area (TMBA) were tested for IgG1 and IgG3 to four P. falciparum antigens and measles antigen, as well as total serum IgG. Multivariable linear regression was conducted to assess the association of peripheral P. falciparum infection during pregnancy or placental P. falciparum infection assessed at delivery with maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency. Path analysis assessed the extent to which associations between P. falciparum infection and antibody transfer were mediated by gestational age at delivery or levels of maternal total serum IgG. Results: Maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency of IgG1 and IgG3 was lower in PNG compared to TMBA (mean difference in cord antibody levels (controlling for maternal antibody levels) ranged from -0.88 to 0.09, median of -0.20 log2 units). Placental P. falciparum infections were associated with substantially lower maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency in PNG primigravid women (mean difference in cord antibody levels (controlling for maternal antibody levels) ranged from -0.62 to -0.10, median of -0.36 log2 units), but not multigravid women. The lower antibody transfer efficiency amongst primigravid women with placental infection was only partially mediated by gestational age at delivery (proportion indirect effect ranged from 0% to 18%), whereas no mediation effects of maternal total serum IgG were observed. Discussion: Primigravid women may be at risk of impaired maternofetal antibody transport with placental P. falciparum infection. Direct effects of P. falciparum on the placenta, rather than earlier gestational age and elevated serum IgG, are likely responsible for the majority of the reduction in maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency with placental infection. © 2017 McLean et al.

To gain an insight into bacterial genomic contents and structures, comparative genome analyses were performed using the reference and newly sequenced genomes of F. columnare including genomovar I, II and I/II strains isolated from Thailand, Europe and the USA. Bacterial genomes varied in size from 3.09 to 3.39 Mb (2714 to 3101 CDSs). The pan-genome analysis revealed open pan-genome nature of F. columnare strains, which possessed at least 4953 genes and tended to increase progressively with the addition of a new genome. Genomic islands (GIs) present in bacterial genomes were diverse, in which 65% (39 out of 60) of possible GIs were strain-specific. A CRISPR/cas investigation indicated at least two different CRISPR systems with varied spacer profiles. On the other hand, putative virulence genes, including those related to gliding motility, type IX secretion system (T9SS), outer membrane proteins (Omp), were equally distributed among F. columnare strains. The MLSA scheme categorized bacterial strains into nine different sequence types (ST 9–17). Phylogenetic analyses based on either 16S rRNA, MLSA and concatenated SNPs of core genome revealed the diversity of F. columnare strains. DNA homology analysis indicated that the estimated digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) between strains of genomovar I and II can be as low as 42.6%, while the three uniquely tilapia-originated strains from Thailand (1214, NK01 and 1215) were clearly dissimilar to other F. columnare strains as the dDDH values were only 27.7–30.4%. Collectively, this extensive diversity among bacterial strains suggested that species designation of F. columnare would potentially require re-emendation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Comparative genomics; Flavobacterium columnare; Genetic diversity; Pan-genome; Taxonomy,"outer membrane protein; RNA 16S; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial secretion system; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; comparative genome analysis; controlled study; CRISPR Cas system; digital DNA DNA hybridization; DNA DNA hybridization; Europe; Flavobacterium; Flavobacterium columnare; genetic parameters; genome; genomic island; genomics; nonhuman; pan genome; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; protein localization; sequence alignment; sequence diversity; sequence homology; single nucleotide polymorphism; species difference; taxonomy; Thailand; type IX secretion system; United States; animal; classification; DNA sequence; fish; fish disease; Flavobacteriaceae infection; Flavobacterium; genetics; microbiology; veterinary; Animals; Fish Diseases; Fishes; Flavobacteriaceae Infections; Flavobacterium; Genome, Bacterial; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article

In the present study, using a polyclonal antibody against an abalone, H asinina, ELH (aELH) we could detect the aELH-like immunoreactivity (aELH-l-ir) in the central nervous system (CNS) and ovary of the blue swimming crab Portunus pelagicus. In protocerebrum, aELH-l-ir was detected in the small- and medium- sized neurons of cluster 6, anterior/posterior medial protocerebral neuropils, protocerebral bridge and central body. In deutocerebrum, the aELH-l-ir was observed in small-sized neurons of cluster 9, fibers between small-sized neurons of cluster 10, medium-sized neurons of cluster 11, olfactory neuropil and medial/lateral antenna I neuropils. In tritocerebrum, the medium- sized neurons of cluster 16, the tritocerebral commissure, and tegumental neuropil showed strong aELH-l-ir. In the ventral nerve cord, the aELH-l-ir was detected in the small- and medium-sized neurons of dorsolateral clusters of subesophageal ganglion. There was no aELH-l- ir in neurons of thoracic ganglion, but aELH-l-ir exhibited a dot-like structure in the subcapsular space around the thoracic neuropils. In abdominal ganglion, the aELH-l-ir was detected in some medium-sized neurons and abdominal neuropils. In the ovary, the aELH-l-ir was detected in the cytoplasm of oogonia, and all steps of developing oocytes. The effect of aELH on ovarian maturation in the crabs was examined by bioassay. When mature female crabs were injected with a dose of 500 ng/g body weight per crab, the ovarian maturation was accelerated as indicated by the rising of gonado-somatic index and levels of vitellin in the ovarian tissue and hemolymph, which was confirmed by histological studies. The aELH also enhanced the proliferation of follicular cells as indicated by the increased number of BrdU-labeled nuclei. In addition, the aELH also significantly induced the 17β-estradiol and progesterone secretion in the cultured ovarian explant. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the existence of an aELH-liked-peptide in the CNS and ovary of the P. pelagicus, and it can induce the ovarian 17β-estradiol and progesterone production resulting in early ovarian maturation in this crab. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Central nervous system; Egg-laying hormone; Ovarian maturation; Portunus pelagicus; Steroidogenesis,antibody; bioassay; cells and cell components; crab; histology; hormone; immune response; maturation; nervous system; peptide; snail; steroid; Callinectes danae; Decapoda (Crustacea); Haliotidae; Mollusca; Portunus pelagicus,Article

Box 1316943551, Tehran, Iran","The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is a major pre-erythrocyte vaccine candidate. The protein has a central repeat region that belongs to one of repeat families (VK210, VK247, and the P. vivax-like). In the present study, computer modelling was employed to select chimeric proteins, comprising the conserved regions and different arrangements of the repeat elements (VK210 and VK247), whose structure is similar to that of the native counterparts. DNA encoding the selected chimeras (named CS127 and CS712) were synthetically constructed based on E. coli codons, then cloned and expressed. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; anti-Pv-210-CDC and −Pv-247-CDC), recognized the chimeric antigens in ELISA, indicating correct conformation and accessibility of the B-cell epitopes. ELISA using IgG from plasma samples collected from 221 Iranian patients with acute P. vivax showed that only 49.32% of the samples reacted to both CS127 and CS712 proteins. The dominant subclass for the two chimeras was IgG1 (48% of the positive responders, OD492 = 0.777 ± 0.420 for CS127; 48.41% of the positive responders, OD492 = 0.862 ± 0.423 for CS712, with no statistically significant difference P &gt; 0.05; Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Binding assays showed that both chimeric proteins bound to immobilized heparan sulphate and HepG2 hepatocyte cells in a concentration-dependent manner, saturable at 80 μg/mL. Additionally, anti-CS127 and −CS712 antibodies raised in mice recognized the native protein on the surface of P. vivax sporozoite with high intensity, confirming the presence of common epitopes between the recombinant forms and the native proteins. In summary, despite structural differences at the molecular level, the expression levels of both chimeras were satisfactory, and their conformational structure retained biological function, thus supporting their potential for use in the development of vivax-based vaccine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Biological function; Chimeric VK210/VK247; Circumsporozoite protein; Conformational structure; Plasmodium vivax; Vaccine,"chimeric protein; CS127 protein; CS712 protein; DNA; epitope; heparan sulfate; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin G1; immunoglobulin G2; immunoglobulin G3; immunoglobulin G4; RNA; unclassified drug; circumsporozoite protein, Protozoan; epitope; hybrid protein; malaria vaccine; monoclonal antibody; protein binding; protozoal protein; protozoon antibody; adolescent; adult; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; Article; binding assay; carboxy terminal sequence; child; chimera; codon usage; comparative study; computer model; controlled study; DNA base composition; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Escherichia coli; female; Hep-G2 cell line; human; in vitro study; major clinical study; molecular cloning; molecular weight; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; physical chemistry; Plasmodium vivax malaria; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; prediction; priority journal; protein analysis; protein conformation; protein expression; protein purification; protein secondary structure; protein structure; sporozoite; Western blotting; animal; C57BL mouse; genetics; immunization; immunology; Malaria, Vivax; parasitology; Plasmodium vivax; protein tertiary structure; tumor cell line; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Protozoan; Cell Line, Tumor; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Female; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Immunization; Malaria Vaccines; Malaria, Vivax; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Plasmodium vivax; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Protozoan Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins",Article

The early effective treatment of high plasma glucose could delay or prevent the onset of DN. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are new target treatments for ameliorating high plasma glucose and help to maintain glucose homeostasis in diabetic patients. Reduced renal glucose reabsorption by SGLT2 inhibition seems to have high potential to improve glycemic control in diabetes mellitus (DM) not only through glucose lowering but also through glucose-independent effects such as blood pressure-lowering and direct renal effects in diabetes. Of note, the important events in the pathogenesis of glucose-induced renal injury and DN including oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis conditions have shown to be ameliorate after the treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors. Interestingly, SGLT2 inhibitors have been reported to reduce albuminuria in DM via an activation of renal tubuloglomerular feedback by increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction and attenuated diabetes-induced renal hyperfiltration. These effects also help to conserve glomerular integrity. Thus, the treatment of diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors could be one of the effective approach for the management of diabetic-associated kidney disease like DN. This review summarizes the up to date information and discusses the bidirectional relationship between the SGLT2 inhibitor treatments and the renal functions that are available from both basic research and clinical reports. The details of renal outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors in DN are also provide in this review. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic nephropathy; Renal function; Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2,glucose; glucose transporter 2; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; clinical trial (topic); controlled clinical trial (topic); diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic patient; drug effect; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; human; hyperglycemia; in vitro study; kidney dysfunction; kidney hypertrophy; kidney injury; kidney proximal tubule; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review,Review

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of α-mangostin on cardiac function. Using a cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane preparation, α-mangostin inhibited SR Ca2+-ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 of 6.47 ± 0.7 μM). Its suppressive effect was specific to SR Ca2+-ATPase but not to myofibrillar Ca2+-ATPase. Using isolated cardiomyocytes, 50 μM of α-mangostin significantly increased the duration of cell relengthening and increased the duration of Ca2+ transient decay, suggesting altered myocyte relaxation. The relaxation effect of α-mangostin was also supported in vivo after intravenous infusion. A significant suppression of both peak pressure and rate of ventricular relaxation (–dP/dt) relative to DMSO infusion was observed. The results from the present study demonstrated that α-mangostin exerts specific inhibitory action on SR Ca2+-ATPase activity, leading to myocardial relaxation dysfunction. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",cardiomyocyte; intracellular Ca2+; myofilament; SERCA,"adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); adenosine triphosphatase (magnesium); alpha mangostin; calcium ion; dimethyl sulfoxide; sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transporting adenosine triphosphatase; unclassified drug; xanthone derivative; mangostin; sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transporting adenosine triphosphatase; xanthone derivative; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cell isolation; concentration response; dose response; drug dose comparison; drug specificity; enzyme inhibition; heart left ventricle pressure; heart left ventricle relaxation; heart muscle relaxation; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; nonhuman; rat; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cardiac muscle; diastole; drug effects; heart ventricle; Leporidae; metabolism; pathophysiology; Animals; Diastole; Heart Ventricles; Male; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Rabbits; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases; Xanthones",Article

This meta-analysis was conducted to summarize all available data. Methods A comprehensive literature review was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE database through May 2017 to identify all studies that reported the risk of AF among patients with NAFLD versus those without NAFLD. Effect estimates from each study were extracted and combined together using the random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results Of 1009 studies, 5 studies (two cross-sectional studies and three cohort studies) with 238,129 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of AF in patients with NAFLD was significantly higher than subjects without NAFLD with the pooled risks ratio of 2.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.10–3.85). The statistical heterogeneity was high with an I2 of 78%, which was the major limitation of this meta-analysis.

Objective: To compare functional outcomes for TE and SPN strategies. Design, setting, and participants: Patients managed with partial nephrectomy (PN) with necessary data for analysis of preservation of ipsilateral parenchymal mass (IPM) and global glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from two centers were included. All studies were required &lt;2 mo before and 3–12 mo after surgery. Patients with a solitary kidney or multifocal tumors were excluded. Intervention: Partial nephrectomy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Vascularized IPM was estimated from contrast-enhanced CT scans preoperatively and postoperatively. Serum creatinine-based estimates of global GFR were also obtained in the same timeframes. Univariable and multivariable linear regression evaluated factors associated with new-baseline global GFR. Results/limitations: Analysis included 71 TE and 373 SPN cases. The median preoperative global GFR was comparable for TE and SPN (75 vs 78 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.6). The median tumor size was 3.0 cm for TE and 3.3 cm for SPN (p = 0.03). The median RENAL score was 7 in both cohorts. For TE, warm ischemia and zero ischemia were used in 51% and 49% of cases, respectively. For SPN, warm ischemia and cold ischemia were used in 72% and 28% of patients, respectively. Capsular closure was performed in 46% of TE and 100% of SPN cases (p &lt; 0.001). Positive margins were found in 8.5% of TE and 4.8% of SPN patients (p = 0.2). The median vascularized IPM preserved was 95% (interquartile range [IQR] 91–100%) for TE and 84% (IQR 76–92%) for SPN (p &lt; 0.001). The median global GFR preserved was 101%(IQR 93–111%) and 89% (IQR 81–96%) for TE and SPN, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable analysis, resection strategy, preoperative GFR, and vascularized IPM preserved were all significantly associated (p &lt; 0.001) with new-baseline global GFR. Limitations include the retrospective design and the lack of resection outcome data. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that TE has potential for maximum IPM preservation compared to SPN and may provide optimized functional recovery. Further investigation will be required to evaluate the clinical significance of these findings. Patient summary: Tumor enucleation for kidney cancer involves dissection along the tumor capsule and optimally preserves normal kidney tissue, which may lead to better functional recovery. The importance of this approach in various clinical settings will require further investigation.

The infection is associated with several hepatobiliary diseases, including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Northeast Thailand is a hotspot for Ov transmission, and, despite extensive public health prevention campaigns led by the government, the prevalence of Ov infection is still high. High infection rates result from cultural and ecological complexities where wet-rice agrarian habitats, centuries-old raw-food culture, and the parasite's complex biology combine to create an ideal transmission arena. Here we review the state of our knowledge regarding the social–ecological determinants underlying Ov transmission. We also describe an integrative research rationale for liver fluke control better aligned with sustainable health development. The distinct socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental history of Northeastern Thailand can provide insights into the intransigence of Ov infection prevalence and disease incidence in the region. Agriculture intensification is associated with significant socioeconomic and ecological changes affecting intermediate hosts, their patterns of abundance and diversity and, in turn, influencing transmission to humans. Recent modeling studies suggest that Ov transmission is seasonal and that control should be practiced seasonally rather than year-round in order to maximize resource utility. A better understanding is needed of how interventions can reduce the consumption of raw fish without discouraging food-sharing behavior that reinforces social coherence, a factor well known to positively influence human health © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",disease ecology; global health; integrated control; landscape epidemiology; Opisthorchis viverrini; transdisciplinarity,climate change; ecology; environmental change; health promotion; human; infection prevention; infection rate; landscape; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis viverrini; parasite control; parasite transmission; public health; Review; seasonal variation; Southeast Asia; animal; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; physiology; prevalence; preventive health service; socioeconomics; standards; Thailand; transmission; Animals; Opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis; Prevalence; Preventive Health Services; Socioeconomic Factors; Thailand,Review

Here we further investigate TiLV infection of archived and newly collected fish samples obtained from Thai hatcheries from 2012 to 2017. Fertilized eggs, yolk-sac larvae, fries, and fingerlings were tested for the TiLV using an established semi-nested RT-PCR assay. The results revealed that the majority of the tested samples were TiLV positive, including our earliest preserved samples collected in year 2012. DNA sequence analysis of representative amplified products also confirmed the presence of TiLV. Since the discovery of TiLV in 2012, over 40 countries worldwide have imported tilapia fry and fingerlings, and some may have been unaware of risk that they might be infected with TiLV. Thus, if they have not already done so, we recommend that countries that have imported tilapia for aquaculture carry out surveillance studies for its presence and also add TiLV to their import quarantine inspection list. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Disease transmission; Tilapia hatcheries; TiLV,cichlid; disease incidence; disease transmission; genetic analysis; hatching; infectious disease; polymerase chain reaction; quarantine; sampling; virus; Thailand; Tilapia,Article

Methods: Seven patients (median age 85 years; 5 women) with CLI and no traditional endovascular or surgical revascularization options (no-option CLI) were recruited in a pilot study to determine the safety of PDVA. All patients were diabetic; 4 had Rutherford category 6 ischemia. Six were classified at high risk of amputation based on the Society for Vascular Surgery WIfI (wound, ischemia, and foot infection) classification. The primary safety endpoints were major adverse limb events and major adverse coronary events through 30 days and serious adverse events through 6 months. Secondary objectives included clinical efficacy based on outcome measures including thermal measurement, transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (TcPO2), clinical improvement at 6 months, and wound healing. Results: The primary safety endpoints were achieved in 100% of patients, with no deaths, above-the-ankle amputations, or major reinterventions at 30 days. The technical success rate was 100%. Two myocardial infarctions occurred within 30 days, each with minor clinical consequences. All patients demonstrated symptomatic improvement with formation of granulation tissue, resolution of rest pain, or both. Complete wound healing was achieved in 4 of 7 patients and 5 of 7 patients at 6 and 12 months, respectively, with a median healing time of 4.6 months (95% confidence interval 84-192). Median postprocedure peak TcPO2 was 61 mm Hg compared to a preprocedure level of 8 mm Hg (p=0.046). At the time of wound healing, 4 of 5 of patients achieved TcPO2 levels of &gt;40 mm Hg. There were 2 major amputations, 1 above the knee after PDVA thrombosis and 1 below the knee for infection. Three patients died of causes unrelated to the procedure or study device at 6, 7, and 8 months, respectively. Limb salvage was 71% at 12 months. Conclusion: PDVA is an innovative approach for treating no-option CLI and represents an alternative option for the ""desert foot,"" potentially avoiding major amputation. Our results demonstrate its safety and feasibility, with promising early clinical results in this small cohort. © The Author(s) 2017.",amputation; arteriovenous fistula; critical limb ischemia; diabetic foot ulcer; no-option critical limb ischemia; percutaneous deep vein arterialization,adult; aged; arteriovenous fistula; artery catheter; balloon dilatation; bare metal stent; clinical article; Conference Paper; critical limb ischemia; female; foot amputation; foot pain; gangrene; heart infarction; heart muscle ischemia; human; human tissue; infrared photography; leg revascularization; male; nitinol stent; open study; osteomyelitis; percutaneous coronary intervention; percutaneous deep vein arterialization; pilot study; pneumonia; priority journal; prospective study; tissue perfusion; treatment outcome; valvulotome; wound healing,Conference Paper

Several studies have tried to identify risk factors for delayed PPB, with inconsistent results. This meta-analysis aims to identify significant risk factors for delayed PPB. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched through January 2016 for studies that investigated the risk factors for delayed PPB. Pooled odds ratio (OR) for categorical variables and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity of effect size was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Results: Twelve articles involving 14,313 patients were included. The pooled delayed PPB rate was 1.5% (95%CI, 0.7–3.4%), I2 = 96%. Cardiovascular disease (OR = 1.55), hypertension (OR = 1.53), polyp size &gt; 10 mm (OR = 3.41), and polyps located in the right colon (OR = 1.60) were identified as significant risk factors for delayed PPB, whereas age, sex, alcohol use, smoking, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, pedunculated morphology, and carcinoma histology were not. Conclusions: Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, polyp size, and polyp location were associated with delayed PPB. More caution is needed when removing polyps in patients with these risk factors. Future studies are warranted to determine appropriate preventive hemostatic measures in these patients. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Bleeding; Colonoscopy; Meta-analysis; Polypectomy; Risk factors,Article; cardiovascular disease; colon polyp; human; hypertension; meta analysis; polypectomy; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; risk factor; systematic review,Article

ZnB with content from 0.0 to 7.0 wt% was added to WPCs, and silane-treated wood contents were varied. The polymers used were poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The decay test was performed according to the European standard EN 113. Loweporus sp., a white-rot fungus, was used for antifungal performance evaluation. Antifungal performance was observed to decrease with wood content. Incorporation of ZnB at 1.0 wt% significantly increased the antifungal performance of WPCs. ZnB content of greater than 1.0 wt% lowered the antifungal properties of WPCs. The results suggested that the wood/PVC composite exhibited better antifungal performance than the wood/HDPE composite. The addition of wood flour to PVC and HDPE decreased flame retardancy, whereas the incorporation of ZnB retained the flame retardancy. ZnB was found to be more appropriate for wood/PVC than wood/HDPE as a result of hydrogen chloride generated from the dehydrochlorination reaction of PVC. The results indicated that the addition of ZnB did not affect the physical-mechanical properties of neat polymers and the composites. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We tested if Goal Directed Therapy (GDT) was feasible for adults and adolescents with clinically suspected ABM in Malawi. Materials and methods: Sequential patient cohorts of adults and adolescents with clinically suspected ABM were recruited in the emergency department of a teaching hospital in Malawi using a before/after design. Routine care was monitored in year one (P1). In year two (P2), nurses delivered protocolised GDT (rapid antibiotics, airway support, oxygenation, seizure control and fluid resuscitation) to a second cohort. The primary endpoint was composite mean number of clinical goals attained. Secondary endpoints were individual goals attained and death or disability from proven or probable ABM at day 40. Results: 563 patients with suspected ABM were enrolled in the study; 273 were monitored in P1; 290 patients with suspected ABM received GDT in P2. 61% were male, median age 33 years and 90% were HIV co-infected. ABM was proven or probable in 132 (23%) patients. GDT attained more clinical goals compared to routine care: composite mean number of goals in P1 was 055 vs. 157 in P2 GDT (p<0001); Death or disability by day 40 from proven or probable ABM occurred in 29/57 (51%) in P1 and 38/60 (63%) in P2 (p = 019).

It is primarily due to excised and/or devascularized parenchymal mass. We evaluated the importance of excised and devascularized parenchymal mass relative to functional recovery after partial nephrectomy. Materials and Methods In 168 patients who underwent partial nephrectomy the necessary studies were done to determine excised and devascularized parenchymal mass, and evaluate parenchymal mass changes and functional loss of the operated kidney. Parenchymal mass loss in the ipsilateral kidney was measured on contrast enhanced computerized tomography less than 2 months before and 3 to 12 months after partial nephrectomy. Excised parenchymal mass was estimated by subtracting tumor volume from specimen volume. Devascularized parenchymal mass was defined as total parenchymal mass loss minus excised parenchymal mass. We used the Pearson correlation to evaluate relationships between glomerular filtration rate preservation and parenchymal mass loss. Multivariable analysis was done to assess factors associated with devascularized parenchymal mass. Results Median tumor size was 3.4 cm and median R.E.N.A.L. (radius, exophytic/endophytic tumor properties, nearness of tumor to collecting system or sinus, anterior/posterior and location relative to polar lines) score was 7. Warm and cold ischemia was used in 100 and 68 patients, respectively. Median excised parenchymal and devascularized parenchymal mass was 9 and 16 cm3, respectively (p &lt;0.001). Total parenchymal mass loss and devascularized parenchymal mass were associated strongly with glomerular filtration rate preservation in the operated kidney (each r ≥0.55, p &lt;0.001). However, excised parenchymal mass was only weakly associated with functional outcomes (r = 0.23). The preoperative glomerular filtration rate and endophytic status were associated with devascularized parenchymal mass on multivariable analysis. Conclusions To our knowledge we report the first study to specifically evaluate the relative contributions of devascularized and excised parenchymal mass to functional recovery after partial nephrectomy.

Nonetheless, the validity and reliability of mFTQ at the international level is still needed. The current study is the first to test the validity and reliability of mFTQ in four countries: Thailand, Spain, the USA, and Russia. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey, mFTQ, risk factors of nicotine dependence, and sociodemographic characteristics were assessed. Risk factors included age of first cigarette, frequency of alcohol use, frequency of marijuana use, and number of cigarettes smoked yesterday. Salivary cotinine was also obtained in Thailand and Spain. Results: For all four countries, mFTQ exhibited a single factor structure, as supported by previous work in the USA. For all studied countries except Thailand, mFTQ presented acceptable internal reliability. Overall, risk factors of nicotine dependence have predicted mFTQ scores across countries. Frequency of alcohol use in the USA and frequency of marijuana use in Thailand and Spain were not associated with mFTQ scores. Discussion and Conclusions: mFTQ is a single-factor measure of nicotine dependence that shows acceptable internal consistency and validity across countries. Further work can advance the scale and tailor it to different cultures. Scientific Significance: mFTQ can be a clinically practical international measure of nicotine dependence. This study provides initial support for the utility of the mFTQ among Thai, Spanish, American, and Russian adolescents. Further research is needed to test and advance mFTQ across cultures.

However, although generic products contain the same level of the active compound, the levels and types of additives present can differ from those used in the original product. Since docetaxel is highly lipophilic, polysorbate 80 (PS80), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and ethyl alcohol are employed to solubilize this anticancer agent. This retrospective study compared the safety of five docetaxel products (Taxotere®, Docetaxel Hospira, Docetaxel Sandoz, Docetaxel Sawai, and Docetaxel EE). Methods: The incidence and severity of adverse events were analyzed using the medical records of operable breast cancer patients (n = 363) treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) in Showa University Hospital, Japan, from Jan 2013 to Mar 2016. Toxicities were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Results: Significant product-related differences were observed in the following non-hematological adverse events: injection site reaction (P = 0.0012), hand-foot syndrome (≥grade 3) (P = 0.0003), and oral mucositis (≥grade 3) (P = 0.0080). Multivariate logistic regression analyses of the associations between these adverse events and the total additive administered (g/m2) identified significant negative effects of PS80 and ethyl alcohol. Conclusions: Injectable docetaxel products had different adverse event profiles, which showed negative associations with the amounts of PS80 and ethyl alcohol present. This finding indicated that there might be additive-related pharmacokinetic and physiochemical differences among these products, suggesting a need for further pre- or post-approval testing of injectable generic products containing noticeable different levels of additives. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Additive; Adverse events; Docetaxel; Generic drug; Polysorbate 80; Retrospective study,"alcohol; antineoplastic agent; carboplatin; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; ee; hospira; pertuzumab; polysorbate 80; sandoz; sawai; trastuzumab; antineoplastic agent; docetaxel; excipient; generic drug; taxoid; adjuvant therapy; adult; anemia; Article; body weight disorder; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; controlled study; diarrhea; disease severity; drug safety; edema; female; hand foot syndrome; human; infusion related reaction; injection site reaction; Japan; leukopenia; major clinical study; myalgia; neuropathy; neutropenia; oral mucositis; priority journal; rash; retrospective study; taste disorder; thrombocytopenia; university hospital; aged; breast tumor; chemistry; comparative study; incidence; middle aged; multivariate analysis; solubility; statistical model; therapeutic equivalence; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Drugs, Generic; Excipients; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Solubility; Taxoids; Therapeutic Equivalency",Article

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can slow down the replication of HIV-1, leading to an improvement in the survival of HIV-1-infected patients. However, drug toxicities and poor drug administration has led to the emergence of a drug-resistant strain. HIV-1 immunotherapy has been continuously developed, but antibody therapy and HIV vaccines take time to improve its efficiency and have limitations. HIV-1-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- based immunotherapy founded on neutralizing antibodies is now being developed. In HIV-1 therapy, anti-HIV chimeric antigen receptors showed promising data in the suppression of HIV-1 replication; however, autologous transfusion is still a problem. This has led to the development of effective peptides and proteins for an alternative HIV-1 treatment. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of potent anti-HIV-1 peptides and proteins that reveal promising therapeutic activities. The inhibitory mechanisms of each therapeutic molecule in the different stages of the HIV- 1 life cycle will be discussed herein. © 2017 by the authors.Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Assembly inhibitor; Entry inhibitor; Fusion inhibitor; HIV; HIV gene therapy; HIV vaccine; Integration inhibitor,acute HIV infection; Review,Review

Although quinolone-resistant S. Enteritidis has been observed with high frequency in Thailand, information on the mechanism of resistance acquisition is limited. To elucidate the mechanism, a total of 158 clinical isolates of nalidixic acid (NAL)-resistant S. Enteritidis were collected throughout Thailand, and the quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in the context of resistance levels to NAL, norfloxacin (NOR), and ciprofloxacin (CIP). The analysis of point mutations in type II topoisomerase genes and the detection of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes showed that all but two harbored a gyrA mutation, the qnrS1 gene, or both. The most commonly affected codon in mutant gyrA was 87, followed by 83. Double codon mutation in gyrA was found in an isolate with high-level resistance to NAL, NOR, and CIP. A new mutation causing serine to isoleucine substitution at codon 83 was identified in eight isolates. In addition to eighteen qnrS1-carrying isolates showing nontypical quinolone resistance, one carrying both the qnrS1 gene and a gyrA mutation also showed a high level of resistance. Genotyping by multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis suggested a possible clonal expansion of NAL-resistant strains nationwide. Our data suggested that NAL-resistant isolates with single quinolone resistance determinant may potentially become fluoroquinolone resistant by acquiring secondary determinants. Restricted therapeutic and farming usage of quinolones is strongly recommended to prevent the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.",gyrA; MLVA; qnrS1; quinolone resistance; Salmonella Enteritidis,amoxicillin; ampicillin; bacterial DNA; cefotaxime; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; clavulanic acid; cotrimoxazole; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) A; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) B; genomic DNA; gentamicin; nalidixic acid; norfloxacin; protein ParC; streptomycin; tetracycline; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium isolate; clonal evolution; codon; genotype; minimum inhibitory concentration; multilocus sequence typing; mutant; mutational analysis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; plasmid; point mutation; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; qnra gene; qnrb gene; qnrs1 gene; Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis; Thailand; variable number of tandem repeat,Article

A parasitological investigation was conducted in Ban Lak Sip village, Luang Prabang, Lao PDR involving fecal samples from 305 inhabitants as well as water samples taken from 3 sites of the local stream. Water analysis indicated the presence of several enteric pathogens, i.e., Aeromonas spp., Vibrio spp., E. coli H7, E. coli O157: H7, verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC), Shigella spp., and enteric adenovirus. The level of microbial pathogens contamination was associated with human activity, with greater levels of contamination found at the downstream site compared to the site at the village and upstream, respectively. Regarding intestinal parasites, the prevalence of helminth and protozoan infections were 68.9% and 27.2%, respectively. Eight helminth taxa were identified in fecal samples, i.e., 2 tapeworm species (Taenia sp. and Hymenolepis diminuta), 1 trematode (Opisthorchis sp.), and 5 nematodes (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Strongyloides stercoralis, trichostrongylids, and hookworms). Six species of intestinal protists were identified, i.e., Blastocystis hominis, Cyclospora spp., Endolimax nana, Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar, Entamoeba coli, and Giardia lamblia. Questionnaires and interviews were also conducted to determine risk factors of infection. These analyses together with a prevailing infection level suggested that most of villagers were exposed to parasites in a similar degree due to limited socio-economic differences and sharing of similar practices. Limited access to effective public health facilities is also a significant contributing factor. © 2017, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine.",Ascaris lumbricoides; Blastocystis hominis; Cyclospora sp; Endolimax nana; Entamoeba coli; Entamoeba histolytica; Environment; Giardia lamblia; Hookworm; Lao PDR; Opisthorchis sp; Risk factor; Strongyloides stercoralis; Taenia sp; Trichuris trichiura; Water,"adolescent; adult; Article; cestode; eating habit; epidemic; feces analysis; female; helminth; helminthiasis; hookworm; human; human activities; hygiene; infection risk; intestine infection; intestine parasite; Laos; major clinical study; male; microbial contamination; nematode; nonhuman; parasite examination; parasite prevalence; parasitosis; protist; protozoon; rural area; sex difference; socioeconomics; trematode; water analysis; water contamination; child; epidemic; feces; intestine infection; microbiology; middle aged; parasitology; prevalence; questionnaire; risk factor; rural population; statistics and numerical data; water pollution; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Disease Outbreaks; Feces; Female; Humans; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic; Laos; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution; Young Adult",Article

CD4 cell count is used with portable CD4 counters in resource-limited settings to manage HIV/AIDS patients. A method comparison was performed using capillary and venous samples from seven clinical laboratories in five countries. The BD FACSPresto system was assessed for variability between laboratory, instrument/operators, cartridge lots and within-run at four sites. Methods: Samples were collected under approved voluntary consent. EDTA-anticoagulated venous samples were tested for CD4 and %CD4 T cells using the gold-standard BD FACSCalibur™ system, and for Hb, using the Sysmex® KX-21N™ analyzer. Venous and capillary samples were tested on the BD FACSPresto system. Matched data was analyzed for bias (Deming linear regression and Bland- Altman methods), and for concordance around the clinical decision point. The coefficient of variation was estimated per site, instrument/operator, cartridge-lot and between-runs. Results: For method comparison, 93% of the 720 samples were from HIV-positive and 7% from HIV-negative or normal subjects. CD4 and %CD4 T cells venous and capillary results gave slopes within 0.96&#150;1.05 and R2 ≥0.96; Hb slopes were ≥1.00 and R2 ≥0.89. Variability across sites/operators gave %CV &lt;5.8% for CD4 counts, &lt;1.9% for %CD4 and &lt;3.2% for Hb. The total %CV was &lt;7.7% across instrument/cartridge lot.

This paper evaluates the impact of a 2-day peer-delivered Acute Care Skills Training (ACST) course as part of the GIP. Study design The ACST course was developed by an interprofessional faculty, including newly graduated doctors awaiting internship (pre-intern), focusing on the recognition and management of common medical and surgical emergencies. Course delivery was entirely by pre-intern doctors to their peers. Knowledge was evaluated by a pre- and post-course multiple choice test. Participants’ confidence (post-course) and 12 acute care skills (pre- and post-course) were assessed using Likert scale-based questions. A subset of participants provided feedback on the peer learning experience. Results Seventeen courses were delivered by a faculty consisting of eight peer trainers over 4 months, training 320 participants. The mean (SD) multiple choice questionnaire score was 71.03 (13.19) pre-course compared with 77.98 (7.7) post-course (p<0.05). Increased overall confidence in managing ward emergencies was reported by 97.2% (n=283) of respondents. Participants rated their post-course skills to be significantly higher (p<0.05) than pre-course in all 12 assessed skills. Extended feedback on the peer learning experience was overwhelmingly positive and 96.5% would recommend the course to a colleague. Conclusions A peer-delivered ACST course was extremely well received and can improve newly qualified medical graduates’ knowledge, skills and confidence in managing medical and surgical emergencies. This peer-based model may have utility beyond pre-interns and beyond Sri Lanka. © Article author(s).",Acute care; Clinical skills; Education and learning; Patient safety; Peer learning,"adult; clinical practice; controlled study; emergency care; emergency surgery; female; human; learning; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; multiple choice test; practice gap; questionnaire; skill; Sri Lanka; study design; training; clinical competence; education; educational model; intensive care; medical education; peer review; program development; program evaluation; United Kingdom; Clinical Competence; Critical Care; Educational Measurement; Humans; Internship and Residency; Models, Educational; Peer Review; Professional Practice Gaps; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Sri Lanka; United Kingdom",Article

Povidone iodine (PVP-I), in use for several decades, has the broadest spectrum of activity, a persistent antimicrobial effect, an ability to penetrate biofilms, and a lack of acquired or cross-resistance. It demonstrates good skin tolerance and low cytotoxicity. However, some reports on PVP-I have raised concerns over allergy, ineffective penetration, and toxic effects on host cells. The majority of these concerns are based on in vitro or rodent wound studies with diverse study designs and outcomes; these results may not be directly applicable in the clinical reality in humans. In this paper, we discuss the efficacy and safety of PVP-I and outline its place in wound healing in Asia, based on an appraisal of recent literature and clinical practice across the region. © 2017 S.

This study aimed to use a population-based cohort of patients with incident sarcoidosis to better describe the characteristics of hepatic sarcoidosis.Methods:A cohort of incident cases of sarcoidosis in Olmsted County, MN, USA, from 1976 to 2013 was identified from the database. Diagnosis was verified by individual medical record review. Confirmed cases of sarcoidosis were then reviewed for liver involvement. Data on clinical manifestations, imaging study, liver biochemical tests, treatment, and outcome were collected. Cumulative incidence of cirrhosis adjusted for the competing risk of death was estimated.Results:A total of 345 cases of incident sarcoidosis were identified. Of these, 19 cases (6%) had liver involvement (mean age 46.1 years, 53% female and 79% Caucasian). Most patients had asymptomatic liver disease and were discovered in pursuit of abnormal biochemical tests and imaging studies. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were elevated in the majority of patients (88 and 90%, respectively). Elevated transaminases were less common and less severe. About half of patients had abnormal imaging study with hypodense nodular lesions being the most common abnormality (six patients) followed by hepatomegaly (three patients). Liver biopsy revealed non-caseating granuloma in 88% (14 of 16 patients). A total of four patients developed cirrhosis.Conclusions:Involvement of the liver by sarcoidosis was seen in 6% of patients with sarcoidosis. The majority of patients were asymptomatic. Elevated ALP and GGT were the most common abnormal biochemical tests. Liver biopsy revealed non-caseating granuloma in almost all cases. Cirrhosis was seen in a significant number of patients. Generalizability of the observations to other populations may be limited, as the studied population was predominantly Caucasian. The prevalence of liver disease may be higher in more diverse populations. © 2017 by the American College of Gastroenterology.",,"alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; gamma glutamyltransferase; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; methotrexate; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; aminotransferase; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; biochemical analysis; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; corticosteroid therapy; female; follow up; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; granuloma; hepatic sarcoidosis; human; human tissue; immunosuppressive treatment; liver biopsy; liver cirrhosis; liver disease; lung sarcoidosis; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; priority journal; retrospective study; sarcoidosis; aged; Asymptomatic Diseases; biopsy; diagnostic imaging; incidence; liver; liver cirrhosis; Liver Diseases; liver function test; medical record; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; sarcoidosis; statistics and numerical data; United States; Aged; Asymptomatic Diseases; Biopsy; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Diseases; Liver Function Tests; Male; Medical Records, Problem-Oriented; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sarcoidosis; Transaminases; United States",Article

Methodology: This study enrolled HIV-infected Thais who were treated with third-line regimens consisting of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r), etravirine (ETR), tipranavir/ritonavir or raltegravir. Results: Fifty-four adolescents 2-17 years of age were enrolled from 8 sites and followed for 48 weeks. Reasons for switch were second-line failure (n = 44) and toxicity to second-line regimens (n = 10). At switching to third-line ARV, the median age (interquartile range) was 14.3 (12.4-15.4) years. Genotypes at time of second-line failure (n = 44) were M184V (77%), ≥4 thymidine analogue mutations (25%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant associated mutation (RAM) (80%), ETR-RAM score ≥4 (14%), any lopinavir-RAM (59%) and ≥1 major DRV-RAM (41%). The third-line regimens had a median of 4 (min-max, 4-6) drugs and included ETR/DRV/r (43%), DRV/r (33%), ETR (17%), tipranavir/ritonavir (2%) or raltegravir/DRV/r/ (4%). The median CD4 (interquartile range) increased from 16% (12-21) at third-line switch to 21% (18-25) and 410 (172-682) to 607 (428-742) cells/mm3 at 48 weeks (P &lt; 0.001). HIV RNA declined from 3.9 (2.9-4.9) to 1.6 (1.6-3.0) log10 copies/mL (P &lt; 0.001) and 33/50 (66%) had levels &lt;50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Seventeen (31%) had HIV-RNA ≥1000 copies/mL; about half due to poor adherence; genotyping in 13 of these adolescents revealed ETR-RAM score ≥4 in 2 (15%) and ≥1 major DRV-RAM in 7 (54%). Conclusions: Third-line ARV therapy was well tolerated and resulted in virologic suppression in 70% of adolescents at 1 year. Poor adherence and limited ARV options are major problems in the long-term management of adolescents with HIV. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Despite this benefit, patients in the panobinostat arm experienced higher rates of adverse events (AEs) and higher rates of discontinuation due to AEs. This PANORAMA 1 subanalysis examined AEs between 2 treatment phases of the study (TP1 and TP2), in which administration frequency of bortezomib and dexamethasone differed per protocol. The incidences of several key AEs were lower in both arms following the planned reduction of bortezomib dosing frequency in TP2. In the panobinostat arm, rates of thrombocytopenia (grade 3/4: TP1, 56·7%; TP2, 6·0%), diarrhoea (grade 3/4: TP1, 24·1%; TP2, 7·1%), and fatigue (grade 3/4: TP1, 16·3%; TP2, 1·8%) were lower in TP2 compared with TP1. Dose intensity analysis of panobinostat and bortezomib by cycle in the panobinostat arm showed reductions of both agent doses during cycles 1–4 due to dose adjustments for AEs.

This region of gD contains most of the binding site for HVEM, an HSV receptor important for virus infection of epithelial cells and lymphocytes. RV144 induced antibodies to HIV that were partially protective against infection, as well as antibodies to HSV. We derived monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from peripheral blood B cells of recipients of the RV144 HIV vaccine and showed that these antibodies neutralized HSV-1 infection in cells expressing HVEM, but not the other major virus receptor, nectin-1. The MAbs mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and mice that received the MAbs and were then challenged by corneal inoculation with HSV-1 had reduced eye disease, shedding, and latent infection. To our knowledge, this is the first description of MAbs derived from human recipients of a vaccine that specifically target the HVEM binding site of gD. In summary, we found that monoclonal antibodies derived from humans vaccinated with the HVEM binding domain of HSV-1 gD (i) neutralized HSV-1 infection in a cell receptor-specific manner, (ii) mediated ADCC, and (iii) reduced ocular disease in virus-infected mice. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.",ADCC; Glycoprotein D; Herpes simplex virus; HIV vaccine; HVEM; Monoclonal antibody; Ocular infection,"antivirus agent; gamunex c; glycoprotein D; herpesvirus entry mediator; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; immunoglobulin; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody ch42; monoclonal antibody ch43; nectin 1; neutralizing antibody; unclassified drug; glycoprotein D, Human herpesvirus 1; glycoprotein gp 120; gp120 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1; herpesvirus entry mediator; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; monoclonal antibody; virus envelope protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody isolation; antigen binding; antiviral activity; Article; B lymphocyte; cell activation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; dose response; female; herpes virus infection; human; Human alphaherpesvirus 1; human cell; in vitro study; infection prevention; latent virus infection; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein interaction; survival; viral eye infection; virus entry; virus shedding; animal; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; Bagg albino mouse; cell line; Eye Diseases; genetics; herpes simplex; immunology; lymphocyte activation; mononuclear cell; Simplexvirus; virology; AIDS Vaccines; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity; Cell Line; Eye Diseases; Female; Herpes Simplex; HIV Envelope Protein gp120; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 14; Simplexvirus; Viral Envelope Proteins",Article

Visser, D.H., VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Tuberculosis remains a global health problem, with an estimated 10.4 million cases and 1.8 million deaths resulting from the disease in 2015. The most lethal and disabling form of tuberculosis is tuberculous meningitis (TBM), for which more than 100,000 new cases are estimated to occur per year. In patients who are co-infected with HIV-1, TBM has a mortality approaching 50%. Study of TBM pathogenesis is hampered by a lack of experimental models that recapitulate all the features of the human disease. Diagnosis of TBM is often delayed by the insensitive and lengthy culture technique required for disease confirmation. Antibiotic regimens for TBM are based on those used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, which probably results in suboptimal drug levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, owing to poor blood-brain barrier penetrance. The role of adjunctive anti-inflammatory, host-directed therapies-including corticosteroids, aspirin and thalidomide-has not been extensively explored. To address this deficit, two expert meetings were held in 2009 and 2015 to share findings and define research priorities. This Review summarizes historical and current research into TBM and identifies important gaps in our knowledge. We will discuss advances in the understanding of inflammation in TBM and its potential modulation; vascular and hypoxia-mediated tissue injury; the role of intensified antibiotic treatment; and the importance of rapid and accurate diagnostics and supportive care in TBM. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

A European network for ICU-related respiratory infections (ENIRRIs), supported by the European Respiratory Society, has been recently established, with the aim at studying all respiratory tract infective episodes except community-acquired ones. A multicentre, observational study is in progress, enrolling more than 1000 patients fulfilling the clinical, biochemical and radiological findings consistent with a LRTI. This article describes the methodology of this study. A specific interest is the clinical impact of non- ICU-acquired nosocomial pneumonia requiring ICU admission, non-ventilator-associated LRTIs occurring in the ICU, and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis. The clinical meaning of microbiologically negative infectious episodes and specific details on antibiotic administration modalities, dosages and duration are also highlighted. Recently released guidelines address many unresolved questions which might be answered by such large-scale observational investigations. In light of the paucity of data regarding such topics, new interesting information is expected to be obtained from our network research activities, contributing to optimisation of care for critically ill patients in the ICU. © ERS 2017.",,Article; artificial ventilation; endotracheal intubation; hospital infection; human; intensive care unit; lung lavage; pulmonary aspiration; tracheobronchitis; tracheostomy,Article

Here we identified recessive mutations in OSGEP, TP53RK, TPRKB, and LAGE3, genes encoding the four subunits of the KEOPS complex, in 37 individuals from 32 families with GAMOS. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout in zebrafish and mice recapitulated the human phenotype of primary microcephaly and resulted in early lethality. Knockdown of OSGEP, TP53RK, or TPRKB inhibited cell proliferation, which human mutations did not rescue. Furthermore, knockdown of these genes impaired protein translation, caused endoplasmic reticulum stress, activated DNA-damage-response signaling, and ultimately induced apoptosis. Knockdown of OSGEP or TP53RK induced defects in the actin cytoskeleton and decreased the migration rate of human podocytes, an established intermediate phenotype of SRNS. We thus identified four new monogenic causes of GAMOS, describe a link between KEOPS function and human disease, and delineate potential pathogenic mechanisms. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

To investigate P. vivax anti-malarial susceptibility in Cambodia, 76 fresh P. vivax isolates collected from Oddar Meanchey (northern Cambodia) in 2013-2015 were assessed for ex vivo drug susceptibility using the microscopy-based schizont maturation test (SMT) and a Plasmodium pan-species lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) ELISA. P. vivax multidrug resistance gene 1 (pvmdr1) mutations, and copy number were analysed in a subset of isolates. Results: Ex vivo testing was interpretable in 80% of isolates using the pLDH-ELISA, but only 25% with the SMT. Plasmodium vivax drug susceptibility by pLDH-ELISA was directly compared with 58 P. falciparum isolates collected from the same locations in 2013-4, tested by histidine-rich protein-2 ELISA. Median pLDH-ELISA IC50 of P. vivax isolates was significantly lower for dihydroartemisinin (3.4 vs 6.3 nM), artesunate (3.2 vs 5.7 nM), and chloroquine (22.1 vs 103.8 nM) than P. falciparum but higher for mefloquine (92 vs 66 nM). There were not significant differences for lumefantrine or doxycycline. Both P. vivax and P. falciparum had comparable median piperaquine IC50 (106.5 vs 123.8 nM), but some P. falciparum isolates were able to grow in much higher concentrations above the normal standard range used, attaining up to 100-fold greater IC50s than P. vivax. A high percentage of P. vivax isolates had pvmdr1 Y976F (78%) and F1076L (83%) mutations but none had pvmdr1 amplification. Conclusion: The findings of high P. vivax IC50 to mefloquine and piperaquine, but not chloroquine, suggest significant drug pressure from drugs used to treat multidrug resistant P. falciparum in Cambodia. Plasmodium vivax isolates are frequently exposed to mefloquine and piperaquine due to mixed infections and the long elimination half-life of these drugs. Difficulty distinguishing infection due to relapsing hypnozoites versus blood-stage recrudescence complicates clinical detection of P. vivax resistance, while well-validated molecular markers of chloroquine resistance remain elusive. The pLDH assay may be a useful adjunctive tool for monitoring for emerging drug resistance, though more thorough validation is needed. Given high grade clinical chloroquine resistance observed recently in neighbouring countries, low chloroquine IC50 values seen here should not be interpreted as susceptibility in the absence of clinical data. Incorporating pLDH monitoring with therapeutic efficacy studies for individuals with P. vivax will help to further validate this field-expedient method. © 2017 The Author(s).",Cambodia; Drug resistance; Ex vivo assay; Plasmodium vivax; pvmdr1,artemisone; artesunate; atovaquone; benflumetol; chloroquine; dihydroartemisinin; doxycycline; mefloquine; multidrug resistance protein 1; piperaquine; quinine sulfate; antimalarial drug susceptibility; Article; Cambodia; controlled study; copy number variation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; ex vivo study; gene mutation; IC50; incubation time; nonhuman; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax multidrug resistance gene 1; schizont; single nucleotide polymorphism,Article

This cytokine is upregulated in cholangiocarcinoma and is implicated in cholangiocarcinoma invasion and metastasis. Here we investigated the roles of non-Smad pathway (ERK1/2) and Smad in TGF-β tumor promoting and suppressing activities in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) cells. Methods: TGF-β1 effects on proliferation, invasion and migration of ICC cells, KKU-M213 and/or HuCCA-1, were investigated using MTT, colony formation, in vitro Transwell and wound healing assays. Levels of mRNAs and proteins/phospho-proteins were measured by quantitative (q)RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. E-cadherin localization was examined by immunofluorescence and secreted MMP-9 activity was assayed by gelatin zymography. The role of ERK1/2 signaling was evaluated by treating cells with TGF-β1 in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, and that of Smad2/3 and Slug using siSmad2/3- and siSlug-transfected cells. Results: h-TGF-β1 enhanced KKU-M213 cell invasion and migration and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition as shown by an increase in vimentin, Slug and secreted MMP-9 levels and by a change in E-cadherin localization from membrane to cytosol, while retaining the cytokine's ability to attenuate cell proliferation. h-TGF-β1 stimulated Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 attenuated TGF-β1-induced KKU-M213 cell invasion and MMP-9 production but moderately enhanced the cytokine growth inhibitory activity. The latter effect was more noticeable in HuCCA-1 cells, which resisted TGF-β-anti-proliferative activity. Smad2/3 knock-down suppressed TGF-β1 ability to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, Slug expression and cell invasion, whereas Slug knock-down suppressed cell invasion and vimentin expression but marginally affected ERK1/2 activation and MMP-9 secretion. These results indicate that TGF-β1 activated ERK1/2 through Smad2/3 but not Slug pathway, and that ERK1/2 enhanced TGF-β1 tumor promoting but repressed its tumor suppressing functions. Conclusions: Inhibiting ERK1/2 activation attenuates TGF-β1 tumor promoting effect (invasion) but retains its tumor suppressing role, thereby highlighting the importance of ERK1/2 in resolving the TGF-β paradox switch. © 2017 The Author(s).",Cholangiocarcinoma; ERK1/2; Invasion; Slug; Smad2/3; TGF-β1,"1,4 diamino 1,4 bis(2 aminophenylthio) 2,3 dicyanobutadiene; gelatinase B; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; phosphoprotein; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; transcription factor Slug; transforming growth factor beta1; uvomorulin; vimentin; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer inhibition; cell invasion; cell invasion assay; cell migration; cell migration assay; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme synthesis; epithelial mesenchymal transition; ERK1/2 signaling; gelatin zymography; gene silencing; HuCC-A1 cell line; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; KKU-M156 cell line; MAPK signaling; MTT assay; protein expression; protein localization; protein secretion; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tumor promotion; Western blotting; wound healing assay; zymography",Article

It is a cholesterol-lowering drug that acts by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, resulting in a decrease in mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). This study investigated the effect of pre-operative oral simvastatin administration on MCP-1 gene expression and serum MCP-1 protein levels in patients with endometriosis. Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted at the Reproductive Endocrinology Unit of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital. Forty women (mean age: 18-45 years) scheduled for laparoscopic surgery who had been diagnosed with endometriosis were recruited and randomly assigned to either a treatment group (20 mg/d of orally administered simvastatin for 2 weeks before surgery) or an untreated control group. Serum was collected before and after treatment and protein levels of MCP-1 were determined. MCP-1 and CD68 transcript levels were also quantified using real-time PCR on endometriotic cyst tissues. Results: MCP-1 gene expression on endometriotic cyst was not significantly different between the simvastatin-treated and untreated groups (P = 0.99). CD68 expression was higher in the treatment group compared to the control group, but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.055). Serum MCP-1 levels following simvastatin treatment were higher than in samples obtained before treatment (297.89 ± 70.77 and 255.51 ± 63.79 pg/ml, respectively) (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Treatment with 20 mg/d of simvastatin for 2 weeks did not reduce the expression of either the chemokine MCP-1 gene or macrophage-specific genes. Cumulatively, this suggests that simvastatin is not ideal for treating endometriosis because a higher dose of simvastatin (40-100 mg/d) would be needed to achieve the target outcome, which would significantly increase the risk of myopathy in patients.

However, a recent assessment of vital registration systems of 148 countries showed poor performance of the death registration system in Myanmar, suggesting the need for improvement. This study assessed the quality of mortality data generated from the vital registration system with regard to mortality levels and patterns, quality of cause of death data, and completeness of death registration in order to identify areas for improvement. Methods: The study used registered deaths in 2013 from the vital registration system, data from the 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census, and mortality indicators and COD information for the country estimated by international organizations. The study applied the guidelines recommended by AbouZahr et al. 2010 to assess mortality levels and patterns and quality of cause of death data. The completeness of death registration was assessed by a simple calculation based on the estimated number of deaths. Results: Findings suggested that the completeness of death registration was critically low (less than 60%). The under-registration was more severe in rural areas, in states and regions with difficult transportation and poor accessibility to health centers and for infant and child deaths. The quality of cause of death information was poor, with possible over-reporting of non-communicable disease codes and a high proportion of ill-defined causes of death (22.3% of total deaths). Conclusion: The results indicated that the vital registration system in Myanmar does not produce reliable mortality statistics. In response to monitoring mortalities as mandated by the Sustainable Development Goals, a significant and sustained government commitment and investment in strengthening the vital registration system in Myanmar is recommended. © 2017 The Author(s).",Myanmar; Quality of mortality data; Vital registration,accessibility; assessment method; cause of death; census; international organization; investment; mortality; population estimation; public health; age distribution; Article; cause of death; child death; communicable disease; human; mortality; mortality rate; Myanmar; non communicable disease; priority journal; registration; rural population; sex ratio; traffic and transport; vital statistics; Myanmar,Article

There are no licensed vaccines, or vector control efforts in place. Despite increasing awareness in endemic regions, the public health burden and global distribution of scrub typhus remains poorly known. Methods: We systematically reviewed all literature from public health records, fever studies and reports available on the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase Classic + Embase and EconLit databases, to estimate the burden of scrub typhus since the year 2000. Findings: In prospective fever studies from Asia, scrub typhus is a leading cause of treatable non-malarial febrile illness. Sero-epidemiological data also suggest that Orientia tsutsugamushi infection is common across Asia, with seroprevalence ranging from 9.3%–27.9% (median 22.2% IQR 18.6–25.7). A substantial apparent rise in minimum disease incidence (median 4.6/100,000/10 years, highest in China with 11.2/100,000/10 years) was reported through passive national surveillance systems in South Korea, Japan, China, and Thailand. Case fatality risks from areas of reduced drug-susceptibility are reported at 12.2% and 13.6% for South India and northern Thailand, respectively. Mortality reports vary widely around a median mortality of 6.0% for untreated and 1.4% for treated scrub typhus. Limited evidence suggests high mortality in complicated scrub typhus with CNS involvement (13.6% mortality), multi-organ dysfunction (24.1%) and high pregnancy miscarriage rates with poor neonatal outcomes. Interpretation: Scrub typhus appears to be a truly neglected tropical disease mainly affecting rural populations, but increasingly also metropolitan areas. Rising minimum incidence rates have been reported over the past 8–10 years from countries with an established surveillance system. A wider distribution of scrub typhus beyond Asia is likely, based on reports from South America and Africa. Unfortunately, the quality and quantity of the available data on scrub typhus epidemiology is currently too limited for any economical, mathematical modeling or mapping approaches. © 2017 Bonell et al.",,antiinfective agent; abortion; acute coronary syndrome; acute kidney failure; Article; brain infection; case fatality rate; central nervous system; disease surveillance; drug sensitivity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fever; global disease burden; human; morbidity; multiple organ failure; newborn mortality; polymerase chain reaction; pregnancy; prospective study; rural population; scrub typhus; seroprevalence; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; systematic review; cost of illness; global health; incidence; isolation and purification; mortality; neglected disease; Orientia tsutsugamushi; scrub typhus; seroepidemiology; survival analysis; tropic climate; Cost of Illness; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Neglected Diseases; Orientia tsutsugamushi; Prospective Studies; Scrub Typhus; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Survival Analysis; Tropical Climate,Article

Recently, MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to involve in various biological processes; their potential usage being a biomarkers and in diagnosis of various diseases. Computational approaches including text mining have been used recently to analyze abstracts from the public databases to observe the relationships/associations between the biological molecules, miRNAs, and disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: In the present study, significance of text mined extracted pair associations (miRNA-lipid disease) were estimated by one-sided Fisher's exact test. The top 20 significant miRNA-disease associations were visualized on Cytoscape. The CyTargetLinker plug-in tool on Cytoscape was used to extend the network and predicts new miRNA target genes. The Biological Networks Gene Ontology (BiNGO) plug-in tool on Cytoscape was used to retrieve gene ontology (GO) annotations for the targeted genes. Results: We retrieved 227 miRNA-lipid disease associations including 148 miRNAs. The top 20 significant miRNAs analysis on CyTargetLinker provides defined, predicted and validated gene targets, further targeted genes analyzed by BiNGO showed targeted genes were significantly associated with lipid, cholesterol, apolipoprotein, and fatty acids GO terms.

This study aims to assess the economic impact of hospitalized dengue cases on households in Chachoengsao province in eastern Thailand. Methods: We conducted a prospective cost-of-illness study of hospitalized pediatric and adult dengue patients at three public hospitals. We examined all hospitalized dengue cases regardless of disease severity. Patients or their legal guardians were interviewed using a standard questionnaire to determine household-level medical and non-medical expenditures and income losses during the illness episode. Results: Between March and September 2015, we recruited a total of 224 hospitalized patients (<5 years, 4%; 5–14 years, 20%, 15–24 years, 36%, 25–34 years, 15%; 35–44 years, 10%; 45+ years, 12%), who were clinically diagnosed with dengue. The total cost of a hospitalized dengue case was higher for adult patients than pediatric patients, and was US$153.6 and US$166.3 for pediatric DF and DHF patients, respectively, and US$171.2 and US$226.1 for adult DF and DHF patients, respectively. The financial burden on households increased with the severity of dengue illness. Conclusions: Although 74% of the households reported that the patient received free medical care, hospitalized dengue illness cost approximately 19–23% of the monthly household income. These results indicated that dengue imposed a substantial financial burden on households in Thailand where a great majority of the population was covered by the Universal Coverage Scheme for health care. © 2017 Tozan et al.",,"adolescent; adult; Article; child; cost of illness; dengue; dengue hemorrhagic fever; disease severity; education; female; financial management; health care cost; health care utilization; hospitalization cost; household; human; income; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prospective study; questionnaire; school attendance; Thailand; young adult; cost of illness; dengue; economics; family size; hospitalization; preschool child; rural population; severe dengue; statistics and numerical data; virology; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost of Illness; Dengue; Family Characteristics; Female; Health Expenditures; Hospitalization; Humans; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Rural Population; Severe Dengue; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thailand; Young Adult",Article

Alternative control measurements of the vector are needed to overcome the problems of environmental contamination and chemical resistance. Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus are symbionts in the intestine of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) Steinernema spp. and Heterorhabditis spp. These bacteria are able to produce a broad range of bioactive compounds including antimicrobial, antiparasitic, cytotoxic and insecticidal compounds. The objectives of this study were to identify Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus isolated from EPNs in upper northern Thailand and to study their larvicidal activity against Ae. aegypti larvae. Results: A total of 60 isolates of symbiotic bacteria isolated from EPNs consisted of Xenorhabdus (32 isolates) and Photorhabdus (28 isolates). Based on recA gene sequencing, BLASTN and phylogenetic analysis, 27 isolates of Xenorhabdus were identical and closely related to X. stockiae, 4 isolates were identical to X. miraniensis, and one isolate was identical to X. ehlersii. Twenty-seven isolates of Photorhabdus were closely related to P. luminescens akhurstii and P. luminescens hainanensis, and only one isolate was identical and closely related to P. luminescens laumondii. Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus were lethal to Ae aegypti larvae. Xenorhabdus ehlersii bMH9.2-TH showed 100% efficiency for killing larvae of both fed and unfed conditions, the highest for control of Ae. aegypti larvae and X. stockiae (bLPA18.4-TH) was likely to be effective in killing Ae. aegypti larvae given the mortality rates above 60% at 72 h and 96 h. Conclusions: The common species in the study area are X. stockiae, P. luminescens akhurstii, and P. luminescens hainanensis. Three symbiotic associations identified included P. luminescens akhurstii-H. gerrardi, P. luminescens hainanensis-H. gerrardi and X. ehlersii-S. Scarabaei which are new observations of importance to our knowledge of the biodiversity of, and relationships between, EPNs and their symbiotic bacteria. Based on the biological assay, X. ehlersii bMH9.2-TH begins to kill Ae. aegypti larvae within 48 h and has the most potential as a pathogen to the larvae. These data indicate that X. ehlersii may be an alternative biological control agent for Ae. aegypti and other mosquitoes. © 2017 The Author(s).",Aedes aegypti; Larvicidal activity; Photorhabdus; Phylogeny; Xenorhabdus,Aedes aegypti; Article; bacterium identification; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; controlled study; entomopathogenic nematode; gene sequence; Heterorhabditis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Photorhabdus; Photorhabdus luminescens; Photorhabdus luminescens akhurstii; Photorhabdus luminescens hainanensis; Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii; phylogeny; RecA gene; Steinernema; Xenorhabdus; Xenorhabdus ehlersii; Xenorhabdus miraniensis; Xenorhabdus stockiae,Article

Similar to other natural products, sericin is a candidate for adjunctive therapy in hyperlipidaemic conditions. However, the cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of sericin are multifactorial and controversial. Here, a high-cholesterol-fed rat model with or without sericin treatment was established using a dosage of 1000 mg/kg/day for 30 days. Blood lipid profiles, oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase, SOD; malondialdehyde, MDA; nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor, Nrf-2), dysmorphic mitochondria in relation to fission (dynamin-related protein-1; Drp-1) and fusion (guanosine triphosphatase mutated in dominant optic atrophy; OPA-1) markers and biosynthetic markers (aquaporin, AQP-1; tubulin-4β, Tb4B) in the pancreas and adrenal gland were evaluated. The results showed that sericin reduced blood cholesterol and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by acting against oxidative stress. Hypocholesterolaemic and antioxidant conditions further preserved heart and liver mitochondrial architecture; however, this protection was not exhibited in the kidney, where a high level of renal mitophagy, indicating by LC-3 up-regulation, was presented. The steps of ultrastructural alteration of mitochondria from degenerative changes to necrosis were also demonstrated. Sericin also conserved AQP-1 and Tb4B levels in the exocrine pancreatic acinar cells and zona glomerulosa cells, which were positively correlated with serum lipase, HDL, antioxidative markers and mitochondrial integrity. The present study revealed that sericin not only has antioxidant capacity but also balances pancreatic and adrenal cell biosynthesis, especially lipase activity, which may have played an important role in improving lipid dysregulation in the hypercholesterolaemic rat model, leading to the reduction of dysmorphic mitochondria, particularly in the heart and liver. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Aquaporin-1; Hypercholesterolaemia; Lipase; Mitochondria; Sericin; Superoxide dismutase; Tubulin-β,"aquaporin 1; beta tubulin; dynamin; dynamin related protein 1; guanosine triphosphatase; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; malonaldehyde; opa 1 protein; sericin; superoxide dismutase; transcription factor Nrf2; triacylglycerol lipase; tubulin 4beta; unclassified drug; antioxidant; cholesterol; sericin; triacylglycerol; adrenal cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biosynthesis; controlled study; cytoarchitecture; heart mitochondrion; histopathology; hypercholesterolemia; immunohistochemistry; liver mitochondrion; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pancreas cell; priority journal; rat; triacylglycerol lipase blood level; upregulation; zona glomerulosa; animal; cell culture; drug effects; heart; hypercholesterolemia; liver; metabolism; mitochondrion; pancreas; pathophysiology; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Antioxidants; Cells, Cultured; Cholesterol; Heart; Hypercholesterolemia; Liver; Mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; Pancreas; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sericins; Triglycerides; Up-Regulation",Article

In in vitro expansion, MSC can give rise to progeny with genomic and epigenomic alterations, resulting in senescence, loss of terminal differentiation, and transformation to cancer. However, MSC genome protects its genetic instability by a guardian function of the P53 tumor suppressor gene and epigenetic balance system during MSC culture. Mutations of P53 and epigenetic alterations have been reported to disrupt the quality and quantity of MSC and initiate tumorigenesis. We monitor P53 and epigenetic changes in MSC derived from amniotic fluid (AF-MSC), amnion membrane (AM-MSC), endometrium (EM-MSC), and Wharton's jelly (WJ-MSC) by the missense mutation analysis of the P53 gene and the expression levels of P53, and epigenetic insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and H19-imprinted genes. Our work demonstrates a variation of P53 expression among different MSC types. AF-MSC has a high P53 expression level with retaining a stability of P53 expression throughout a long culture period, whereas EM-MSC and WJ-MSC showed variation of P53 gene expression during culture. Epigenetic analysis showed a stable H19 expression pattern in AF-MSC, AM-MSC, and EM-MSC culture, whereas H19 expression fluctuated in WJ-MSC culture. We conclude that gene instability can be found during in vitro MSC expansion. With awareness to MSC quality and safety in MSC transformation risk, P53 mutation and IGF2 and H19-imprinted gene analysis should be applied to monitor in therapeutic-grade MSC. We also demonstrated that AF-MSC is one of the most interesting MSC for medical therapy because of its high genomic stability and epigenetic fidelity. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.",amnion; amniotic fluid; endometrium; mesenchymal stem cells; Wharton's jelly,"h19 protein; protein; protein p53; somatomedin B; unclassified drug; H19 long non-coding RNA; IGF2 protein, human; long untranslated RNA; protein p53; somatomedin B; amnion cell; amniotic fluid stem cell; Article; cell transformation; controlled study; donor; endometrium cell; epigenetics; female; genetic analysis; genetic variation; genome imprinting; genomic instability; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; mesenchymal stem cell; missense mutation; primary cell culture; priority journal; protein stability; stem cell expansion; amnion fluid; cell culture; cytology; endometrium; genetics; mesenchymal stroma cell; metabolism; missense mutation; Amniotic Fluid; Cells, Cultured; Endometrium; Female; Genomic Imprinting; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor II; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Mutation, Missense; RNA, Long Noncoding; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",Article

Due to the relationship between sex steroid hormones, oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression and cryptorchidism pathogenesis, this study aimed to investigate the mRNA expression and the localization of OTR in relation to sex steroid receptors in the male reproductive tract of both normal and unilateral abdominal cryptorchid dogs using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Male dogs were divided into two groups of normal and cryptorchid dogs. Samples from each cryptorchid dog were separated into two subgroups: scrotal and abdominal subgroups. The results showed that a lower percentage of positive OTR immunostaining in the testis and epididymis was observed in the cryptorchid group compared to the normal group. Within the cryptorchid group, the mRNA expression and the localization of OTR in the testis and epididymis of the abdominal subgroup was less than that of the scrotal subgroup. Moreover, the localization of OTR and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) in reproductive tissues was positively correlated only in the normal group and not in the cryptorchid group. In conclusion, this study proposed that OTR expression, as well as the correlation between the OTR and ERβ in reproductive tissues of male dogs, can be disturbed by cryptorchidism. Furthermore, the OTR, ERβ and their correlation may be involved with the pathogenesis of cryptorchidism. Therefore, the study of gene knockout models to confirm the effect of OTR and sex steroid receptors on canine cryptorchidism should be of interest for further investigation. © 2017",Androgen receptor; Cryptorchidism; Dogs; Estrogen receptors; Oxytocin receptor,"oxytocin receptor; steroid receptor; animal; cryptorchism; dog; dog disease; gene expression regulation; genetics; male; metabolism; physiology; veterinary; Animals; Cryptorchidism; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Receptors, Oxytocin; Receptors, Steroid",Article

Insights into the ligand binding and inhibition properties of human cytosolic SHMT (hcSHMT) and Plasmodium SHMT (PvSHMT) are crucial for designing specific drugs against malaria and cancer. The results presented here revealed strong and pH-dependent THF inhibition of hcSHMT. In contrast, in PvSHMT, THF inhibition and the influence of pH were not as pronounced. Ligand binding experiments performed at various pH values indicated that the hcSHMT:Gly complex binds THF more tightly at lower pH conditions, while the binding affinity of the PvSHMT:Gly complex for THF is not pH-dependent. Pre-steady state kinetic (rapid-quench) analysis of hcSHMT showed burst kinetics, indicating that glycine formation occurs fastest in the first turnover relative to the subsequent turnovers i.e. glycine release is the rate-limiting step in the hcSHMT reaction. All data suggest that excess THF likely binds E:Gly binary complex and forms the E:Gly:THF dead-end complex before glycine is released. A unique flap motif found in the structure of hcSHMT may be the key structural feature that imparts these described characteristics of hcSHMT. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Ligand binding; Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; Rapid-quench flow; Rate determining step; Serine hydroxymethyltransferase; Substrate inhibition; Tetrahydrofolate,"glycine; glycine hydroxymethyltransferase; tetrahydrofolic acid; enzyme inhibitor; glycine hydroxymethyltransferase; protozoal protein; SHMT protein, human; Article; binding affinity; complex formation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme structure; enzyme substrate; human; ligand binding; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nonhuman; pH; Plasmodium; priority journal; steady state; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; enzymology; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; protein motif; species difference; Amino Acid Motifs; Enzyme Inhibitors; Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; Protozoan Proteins; Species Specificity",Article

Case Report: A 22-year-old woman presented with severe allergic conjunctivitis for one and a half year. She failed to respond to conventional topical anti-allergic medications, topical corticosteroid, as well as topical cyclosporine A. Therefore, oral corticosteroids had to be prescribed to control the exacerbation for 1 year. Due to refractory AKC and to avoid long-term corticosteroid use, we referred her to an allergy clinic for considering the role of SCIT. Allergology investigations showed positive skin prick test and strongly elevated serum-specific IgE to Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p). She received a conventional protocol of SCIT using Der f and Der p allergen extracts. Results: The patient's ocular signs and symptoms were dramatically improved 2 months after the initiation of SCIT, and oral corticosteroids could be discontinued within 3 months of the treatment. She was maintained with mast cell stabilizers and preservative-free tears without any episodes of exacerbation. Conclusions: SCIT may contribute to successful outcomes in controlling symptoms and preventing exacerbation in AKC patient. It should be considered as an alternative or even a primary treatment for patients with refractory AKC. However, the optimal SCIT protocol must be discussed with an allergist on an individual basis for the best outcome. © 2017 The Author(s).",Atopic keratoconjunctivitis; Immunomodulators; Steroids; Subcutaneous immunotherapy,artificial tear; cyclosporin A; histamine release inhibitor; house dist mite allergen extract; immunoglobulin E; methylprednisolone; olopatadine; prednisone; adult; allergic conjunctivitis; antibody blood level; Article; atopic keratoconjunctivitis; case report; clinical article; Dermatophagoides farinae; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug treatment failure; female; human; immunotherapy; patient referral; prescription; prick test; priority journal; treatment response; young adult,Article

In Malaysia, where both species are common, zoonotic knowlesi malaria has recently become dominant, and cases are recorded throughout the region. By contrast, to date, only a single case of naturally acquired P cynomolgi has been found in humans. In this study, we show that whereas P cynomolgi merozoites invade monkey red blood cells indiscriminately in vitro, in humans, they are restricted to reticulocytes expressing both transferrin receptor 1 (Trf1 or CD71) and the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor (DARC or CD234). This likely contributes to the paucity of detectable zoonotic cynomolgi malaria. We further describe postinvasion morphologic and rheologic alterations in P cynomolgi–infected human reticulocytes that are strikingly similar to those observed for P vivax.

We investigated the possibility of using smell detection by dogs for detecting HCC from the breath of patients. Patients whose diagnosis of HCC was confirmed histologically or radiologically according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria had breaths collected using face masks and transported to the study test site. The numbering of the HCC samples was sent in a sealed envelope to blind the dog trainer during testing but allow for correct rewarding of the dog afterwards. One golden retriever was trained to detect HCC with positive feedback using known samples of HCC and healthy controls in a step-wise manner. The controls were selected from hospital staff and relatives of patients who were not involved in the study. They were questioned about the risks of their disease before selection. When the trainer was confident that the dog could recognize the HCC scent, blind testing was performed using 1 HCC : 3 healthy controls per test run. Once the dog signaled on a specimen, it was given a reward. The correct-detection rate was compared to the theoretical detection rate expected based on chance of 25% using the statistical one-sample test of proportions. Thirty-seven HCC patients were tested. The patients had a mean age of 58 years and 21/37 were male. Seventeen patients had hepatitis B and 14 patients had hepatitis C. Twenty-six patients had one HCC lesion; four patients had two lesions in the liver, whilst seven had many lesions. The number of patients in the very early, early, intermediate, advanced, and terminal stages of the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification was 5, 9, 21, 1, and 1, respectively. The dog detected correctly in 29 runs. The sensitivity for canine detection was 78% (95% CI: 62%-90%). Compared to the 25% correct indication expected based on chance, this was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This is the first study to look at the possibility of detecting HCC from breath using canine olfaction. Our results show that this is possible with an accuracy of 78% (p < 0.001 when compared to chance alone), and are thus a proof of concept. Further refinement of the process of detection will be needed before clinical application. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",cancer screening; canine; hepatocellular carcinoma; liver cancer; odor detection; scent detection; screening,"adult; Article; breath analysis; cancer staging; clinical article; controlled study; detection dog; diagnostic accuracy; female; golden retriever; human; liver cell carcinoma; male; nonhuman; positive feedback; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; aged; animal; breath analysis; dog; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; middle aged; odor; procedures; Aged; Animals; Breath Tests; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Dogs; Female; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Smell",Article

In this study, we demonstrate a new diagnostic procedure for human malaria using loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and the MinION™ nanopore sequencer. Methods: We generated specific LAMP primers targeting the 18S-rRNA gene of all five human Plasmodium species including two P. ovale subspecies (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale wallikeri, P. ovale curtisi, P. knowlesi and P. malariae) and examined human blood samples collected from 63 malaria patients in Indonesia. Additionally, we performed amplicon sequencing of our LAMP products using MinION™ nanopore sequencer to identify each Plasmodium species. Results: Our LAMP method allowed amplification of all targeted 18S-rRNA genes of the reference plasmids with detection limits of 10-100 copies per reaction. Among the 63 clinical samples, 54 and 55 samples were positive by nested PCR and our LAMP method, respectively. Identification of the Plasmodium species by LAMP amplicon sequencing analysis using the MinION™ was consistent with the reference plasmid sequences and the results of nested PCR. Conclusions: Our diagnostic method combined with LAMP and MinION™ could become a simple and accurate tool for the identification of human Plasmodium species, even in resource-limited situations. © 2017 The Author(s).",Diagnosis; LAMP; Malaria; MinION™; Nanopore sequencer; Plasmodium ovale curtisi; Plasmodium ovale wallikeri,"RNA 18S; primer DNA; RNA 18S; 18S rRNA gene; amplicon; Article; controlled study; human; Indonesia; limit of detection; loop mediated isothermal amplification; major clinical study; malaria; molecular diagnostics; nanopore sequencer; nested polymerase chain reaction; parasitemia; plasmid; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium knowlesi; Plasmodium malariae; Plasmodium ovale; Plasmodium vivax; sequence analysis; species identification; devices; genetics; malaria; malaria falciparum; molecular diagnosis; nanopore; nucleic acid amplification; Plasmodium; Plasmodium vivax malaria; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; DNA Primers; Humans; Indonesia; Limit of Detection; Malaria; Malaria, Falciparum; Malaria, Vivax; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Nanopores; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Plasmodium; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S",Article

The clinical presentation of LPP may mimic bullous pemphigoid making the diagnosis difficult. A thorough clinical, histopathological, and immunological evaluation is essential for the diagnosis of LPP. The etiology is largely idiopathic; however, there are several case reports of drug-induced LPP. We report an 81-year-old Thai woman with underlying hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented with a 4-week history of multiple tense bullae initially on the hands and feet that subsequently expanded to the trunk and face. Enalapril was commenced to control hypertension. The histopathology and direct immunofluorescence were compatible with LPP. Circulating anti-basement antibodies BP180 was also positive. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroid with a modest effect. Enalapril was discontinued and complete resolution of LPP occurred within 12 weeks. There was no recurrence after a 1-year follow-up period. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case of enalapril-induced LPP. Early recognition and prompt discontinuation of the culprit drug allow resolution of the disease.

Primaquine is the only widely available 8-aminoquinoline for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax. Tafenoquine is under development with the potential to simplify treatment regimens, but point-of-care (PoC) tests will be needed to provide quantitative measurement of G6PD activity prior to its administration. There is currently a lack of appropriate G6PD PoC tests, but a number of new tests are in development and are likely to enter the market in the coming years. As these are implemented, they will need to be validated in field studies. This article outlines the technical details for the field evaluation of novel quantitative G6PD diagnostics such as sample handling, reference testing and statistical analysis. Field evaluation is based on the comparison of paired samples, including one sample tested by the new assay at point of care and one sample tested by the gold-standard reference method, UV spectrophotometry in an established laboratory. Samples can be collected as capillary or venous blood; the existing literature suggests that potential differences in capillary or venous blood are unlikely to affect results substantially. The collection and storage of samples is critical to ensure preservation of enzyme activity, it is recommended that samples are stored at 4 °C and testing occurs within 4 days of collection. Test results can be visually presented as scatter plot, Bland-Altman plot, and a histogram of the G6PD activity distribution of the study population. Calculating the adjusted male median allows categorizing results according to G6PD activity to calculate standard performance indicators and to perform receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. © 2017 The Author(s).",,glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; blood analysis; capillary blood; field study; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; human; nonhuman; point of care testing; quantitative diagnosis; receiver operating characteristic; Review; sample size; statistical analysis; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; venous blood; world health organization,Review

The control of this vector-borne disease is challenging due to humans being dead-end hosts, vertical maintenance of the pathogen in the vector itself, and a potentially large rodent reservoir of unclear significance, coupled with a lack of accurate diagnostic tests. Development of an effective vaccine is highly desirable. This however requires better characterization of the natural immune response of this neglected but important disease. Here we implement a novel IFN-γ ELISpot assay as a tool for studying O. tsutsugamushi induced cellular immune responses in an experimental scrub typhus rhesus macaque model and human populations. Whole cell antigen for O. tsutsugamushi (OT-WCA) was prepared by heat inactivation of Karp-strain bacteria. Rhesus macaques were infected intradermally with O. tsutsugamushi. Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from infected (n = 10) and uninfected animals (n = 5) were stimulated with OT-WCA, and IFN-γ secreting cells quantitated by ELISpot assay at five time points over 28 days. PBMC were then assayed from people in a scrub typhus-endemic region of Thailand (n = 105) and responses compared to those from a partially exposed population in a non-endemic region (n = 14), and to a naïve population in UK (n = 12). Mean results at Day 0 prior to O. tsutsugamushi infection were 12 (95% CI 0–25) and 15 (2–27) spot-forming cells (SFC)/106PBMC for infected and control macaques respectively. Strong O. tsutsugamushi-specific IFN-γ responses were seen post infection, with ELISpot responses 20-fold higher than baseline at Day 7 (mean 235, 95% CI 200–270 SFC/106PBMC), 105-fold higher at Day 14 (mean 1261, 95% CI 1,097–1,425 SFC/106PBMC), 125-fold higher at Day 21 (mean 1,498, 95% CI 1,496–1,500 SFC/106PBMC) and 118-fold higher at Day 28 (mean 1,416, 95% CI 1,306–1,527 SFC/106PBMC). No significant change was found in the control group at any time point compared to baseline. Humans from a scrub typhus endemic region of Thailand had mean responses of 189 (95% CI 88–290) SFC/106PBMC compared to mean responses of 40 (95% CI 9–71) SFC/106PBMC in people from a non-endemic region and 3 (95% CI 0–7) SFC/106PBMC in naïve controls. In summary, this highly sensitive assay will enable field immunogenicity studies and further characterization of the host response to O. tsutsugamushi, and provides a link between human and animal models to accelerate vaccine development. © 2017 Public Library of Science.

However, many aspects of the molecular mechanism of action of KP remain unclear. In particular, the ability of KP to regulate cancer cell growth and survival signaling is still largely unexplored. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of KP on cell viability, cell migration, cell invasion, cell apoptosis, and on signaling pathways related to growth and survival of cervical cancer cells, HeLa. We discovered that KP reduced HeLa cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. The potent cytotoxicity of KP against HeLa cells was associated with a dose-dependent induction of apoptotic cell death as determined by flow cytometry and observation of nuclear fragmentation. Moreover, KP-induced cell apoptosis was likely to be mediated through the intrinsic apoptosis pathway since caspase 9 and caspase 7, but not BID, were shown to be activated after KP exposure. Based on the observation that KP induced apoptosis in HeLa cell, we further investigated the effects of KP at non-cytotoxic concentrations on suppressing signal transduction pathways relevant to cell growth and survival. We found that KP suppressed the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in cells activated with EGF, as observed by a significant decrease in phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Elk1, PI3K, and AKT. The data suggest that KP interferes with the growth and survival of HeLa cells. Consistent with the inhibitory effect on EGF-stimulated signaling, KP potently suppressed the migration of HeLa cells. Concomitantly, KP was demonstrated to markedly inhibit HeLa cell invasion. The ability of KP in suppressing the migration and invasion of HeLa cells was associated with the suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 production. These data strongly suggest that KP may slow tumor progression and metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. Taken together, the present report provides accumulated evidence revealing the potent anti-cancer activities of Kaempferia parviflora against cervical cancer HeLa cells, and suggests its potential use as an alternative way for cervical cancer prevention and therapy. © 2017 Potikanond, Sookkhee, Na Takuathung, Mungkornasawakul, Wikan, Smith and Nimlamool.",Anti-cancer; Apoptosis; Cervical cancer; Invasion; Kaempferia parviflora; MAPK pathway; Migration; PI3K/AKT pathway,antineoplastic agent; caspase 7; caspase 9; epidermal growth factor; Kaempferia parviflora extract; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; plant extract; protein kinase B; transcription factor Elk 1; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cell activation; cell damage; cell growth; cell invasion; cell migration; cell nucleus; cell survival; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug isolation; drug potency; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme synthesis; H1HeLa cell line; human; human cell; Kaempferia; Kaempferia parviflora; MAPK signaling; metastasis inhibition; Pi3K/Akt signaling; protein synthesis inhibition; signal transduction; uterine cervix cancer,Article

Naturally acquired antibody responses against multiple P. vivax proteins have been described in numerous countries, however, direct comparison of these responses has been difficult with different methodologies employed. We measured antibody responses against 307 P. vivax proteins at the time of P. vivax infection, and at 2–3 later time-points in three countries. We observed that seropositivity rates at the time of infection were highest in Thailand, followed by Brazil then PNG, reflecting the level of antigenic input. The majority of sero-reactive antigens in all sites induced short-lived antibody responses with estimated half-lives of less than 6 months, although there was a trend towards longer-lived responses in PNG children. Despite these differences, IgG seropositivity rates, magnitude and longevity were highly and significantly rank-correlated between the different regions, suggesting such features are reflective of the individual protein. © 2017 Longley et al.",,"chloroquine; primaquine; immunoglobulin G; parasite antigen; protozoal protein; protozoon antibody; antibody response; Article; child; clinical article; controlled study; directly observed therapy; elimination parameters; female; follow up; gene expression; geographic distribution; human; immunogenicity; infection control; longitudinal study; male; microscopy; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; protein expression; protein synthesis; public health; recurrent infection; seroprevalence; adolescent; adult; aged; antibody production; blood; Brazil; comparative study; half life time; immunology; middle aged; Papua New Guinea; parasitology; Plasmodium vivax malaria; Thailand; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Protozoan; Antibody Formation; Antigens, Protozoan; Brazil; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Half-Life; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Malaria, Vivax; Male; Middle Aged; Papua New Guinea; Plasmodium vivax; Protozoan Proteins; Thailand; Young Adult",Article

In a cross-sectional survey, chronic disease patients accessing primary care were recruited if they had been diagnosed with any of 21 chronic conditions in the past 12 months, and were interviewed with a structured questionnaire on anxiety, depression, alcohol use, tobacco use, dietary behaviour, physical activity, and quality of life. The sample included 6236 public primary care patients (32.8% men and 67.2% women), with a mean age of 53.0 years (SD = 16.8). From 21 chronic conditions, the three most common were hypertension (37.4%), depression (34.4%), and digestive diseases (32.0%). In all, 27.4% had one chronic condition, 28.6% had two, 22.4% had three, and 21.6% had four or more chronic conditions. The percentage with the highest comorbidity was depression (47.3%), hypertension (43.4%), and digestive diseases (34.1%). The highest mean multimorbidity reported was for mental illness (4.44), kidney disease (4.11), and Parkinson’s disease (4.10), and the lowest multimorbidity for epilepsy (2.43) and cancer (2.80).

Methods: We conducted a survey of extended β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolated from patients, canals and livestock wastewater in eastern Thailand between 2014 and 2015, and analyzed isolates using whole genome sequencing. Results: The bacterial collection of 149 isolates consisted of 84 isolates from a single hospital and 65 from the hospital sewer, canals and farm wastewater within a 20 km radius. E. coli ST131 predominated the clinical collection (28.6%), but was uncommon in the environment. Genome-based comparison of E. coli from infected patients and their immediate environment indicated low genetic similarity overall between the two, although three clinical-environmental isolate pairs differed by ≤ 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Thai E. coli isolates were dispersed throughout a phylogenetic tree containing a global E. coli collection. All Thai ESBL-positive E. coli isolates were multidrug resistant, including high rates of resistance to tobramycin (77.2%), gentamicin (77.2%), ciprofloxacin (67.8%) and trimethoprim (68.5%). ESBL was encoded by six different CTX-M elements and SHV-12. Three isolates from clinical samples (n = 2) or a hospital sewer (n = 1) were resistant to the carbapenem drugs (encoded by NDM-1, NDM-5 or GES-5), and three isolates (clinical (n = 1) and canal water (n = 2)) were resistant to colistin (encoded by mcr-1); no isolates were resistant to both carbapenems and colistin. Conclusions: Tackling ESBL-producing E. coli in this setting will be challenging based on widespread distribution, but the low prevalence of resistance to carbapenems and colistin suggests that efforts are now required to prevent these from becoming ubiquitous. © 2017 The Author(s).",ESBL; Escherichia coli; Genome; Phylogeny; Sequence,"beta lactamase CTX M; beta lactamase SHV; beta lactamase SHV 12; carbapenem; ciprofloxacin; colistin; gentamicin; tobramycin; trimethoprim; unclassified drug; beta lactamase; waste water; agricultural waste; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterium isolate; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Escherichia coli; human; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; sewer; single nucleotide polymorphism; Thailand; waste water; whole genome sequencing; agricultural land; antibiotic resistance; DNA sequence; enzymology; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli infection; genetics; hospital; isolation and purification; microbiology; multidrug resistance; pathophysiology; physiology; beta-Lactam Resistance; beta-Lactamases; Drug Resistance, Multiple; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Farms; Hospitals; Humans; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Thailand; Waste Water",Article

As the protocol itself was introduced about two decades ago, it contains many known attacks which some of them can be patched by a newer version of the router firmware. Nevertheless, a reckless or a poor practice of network operator could jeopardize the system by forgetting to enable the OSPF authentication or use a password that can be easily guessed. Moreover, a lot of routers that still in operating out there are running with the out-of-date firmware, which surely contains security holes. Attacks on routing protocol could lead to severe damage to the network. In this paper, we introduce OSV as a tool to detect the OSPF network vulnerability by checking password strength and performing ten penetration testing against the target OSPF network.

Developing an automatic system, we employ image processing techniques coupled with graph cut algorithms from combinatorial optimization. Avoiding the need of manual pre-segmentation for constructing an initial graph, a supervised learning approach is effectively and efficiently applied. Crucial information is extracted from a set of labeled binary masks and integrated into weight assignments of the edges of the graph. We associate the characteristically bell-shape of a Gaussian distribution with the rounded circular-shape of the optic disc. Our approach was validated and evaluated on the RIM-ONE open database. Segmentation is successful on 91.12% of the entire 169 images, achieving 91% sensitivity and 88% accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.",,Combinatorial optimization; Eye protection; Graphic methods; Image processing; Noninvasive medical procedures; Ophthalmology; Optical data processing; Software engineering; Automatic systems; Fundus photographs; Glaucoma disease; Image processing technique; Optic nerve head; Pre-segmentation; Supervised learning approaches; Weight assignment; Image segmentation,Conference Paper

However, VANETs are still vulnerable to different kind of security attacks due to its infrastructure-less networking. Sybil Attack is a well-known attack in VANET. It forges multiple nodes with different identities to broadcast fake messages to manipulate the road traffic and information. In this paper, we propose a distributed detection mechanism using the neighborhood information. In our approach, a node is considered as a Sybil node if its position is inside the intersected area of two communication nodes, but it does not acknowledge by one of them. Each vehicle exchanges the information of their neighbors periodically via beacon message. The received neighbor information, from each neighbor, will be used to vote on each of the receiver node's neighbor whether they are Sybil. Simulation on different test cases are performed to observe the performance of our algorithm in term of its detection rate and false positive rate. The result depicts the increase of detection rate in the scenario where the number of surrounding neighbors is high. © 2017 IEEE.",NS-3; Security; Sybil Attack; VANETs,Ad hoc networks; Computer crime; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Software engineering; Distributed consensus; Distributed detection; False positive rates; Neighborhood information; Security; Sybil attack; VANETs; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks,Conference Paper

Empirical data on meiotic products are however lacking. This study examined microsatellites in oocysts derived by membrane feeding of mosquitoes from blood-stage P. vivax infections at the Thai-Myanmar border. Methods: Blood samples from patients presenting with vivax malaria were fed to Anopheles cracens by membrane feeding and individual oocysts from midguts were obtained by dissection after 7 days. DNA was extracted from oocysts and parental blood samples and tested by microsatellite analysis. Results: A focused study of eight microsatellite markers was undertaken for nine blood stage infections from 2013, for which derived oocysts were studied in six cases. One or more alleles were successfully amplified for 131 oocysts, revealing high levels of allelic diversity in both blood and oocyst stages. Based on standard criteria for defining minor alleles, there was evidence of clear deviation from random mating (inbreeding) with relatively few heterozygous oocysts compared to variance across the entire oocyst population (FIT = 0.89). The main explanation appeared to be natural compartmentalisation at mosquito (FSC = 0.27) and human stages (FCT = 0.68). One single human case produced a total of 431 successfully amplified loci (across 70 oocysts) that were homozygous and identical to parental alleles at all markers, indicating clonal infection and transmission. Heterozygous oocyst alleles were found at 15/176 (8.5%) successfully amplified loci in the other five cases. There was apparently reduced oocyst heterozygosity in individual oocysts compared to diversity within individual mosquitoes (FIS = 0.55), but this may simply reflect the difficulty of detecting minor alleles in oocysts, given the high rate of amplification failure. Inclusion of minor allele peaks (irrespective of height) when matching peaks were found in related blood or oocyst samples, added 11 minor alleles for 9 oocysts, increasing the number of heterozygous loci to 26/176 (14.8%; p = 0.096). Conclusion: There was an apparently low level of heterozygous oocysts but this can be explained by a combination of factors: relatively low complexity of parental infection, natural compartmentalisation in humans and mosquitoes, and the methodological challenge of detecting minor alleles. © 2017 The Author(s).",Genetic diversity; Meiosis; Oocyst; Plasmodium vivax; Relapse,"allele; animal experiment; animal tissue; Anopheles; Anopheles cracens; Article; blood sampling; clonal variation; controlled study; DNA extraction; female; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; genetic variability; heterozygosity; homozygosity; microsatellite marker; midgut; nonhuman; oocyst; parasite transmission; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; protozoal genetics; animal; blood; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; genotyping technique; heterozygote; human; insect vector; meiosis; Myanmar; oocyst; parasitology; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; Thailand; microsatellite DNA; protozoal DNA; Alleles; Animals; Anopheles; DNA, Protozoan; Female; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Genotyping Techniques; Heterozygote; Humans; Insect Vectors; Malaria, Vivax; Meiosis; Microsatellite Repeats; Myanmar; Oocysts; Plasmodium vivax; Thailand",Article

Herein we conceptualize hospital surge elements, and lessons learnt from such events, to help build appropriately matched responses to future ID surge threats. Methods: We used the Interpretive Descriptive qualitative approach. Interviews (n = 35) were conducted with governance and public health specialists; hospital based staff; and General Practitioners. Key policy literature in tandem with the interview data were used to iteratively generate a Hospital ID Surge framework. We anchored our narrative account within this framework, which is used to structure our analysis. Results: A spectrum of surge threats from combinations of capacity (for crowding) and capability (for treatment complexity) demands were identified. Starting with the Pyramid scenario, or an influx of high screening rates flooding Emergency Departments, alongside fewer and manageable admissions; the Reverse-Pyramid occurs when few cases are screened and admitted but those that are, are complex; during a 'Black' scenario, the system is overburdened by both crowding and complexity. The Singapore hospital system is highly adapted to crowding, functioning remarkably well at constant near-full capacity in Peacetime and resilient to Endemic surges. We catalogue 26 strategies from lessons learnt relating to staffing, space, supplies and systems, crystalizing institutional memory. The DECIDE model advocates linking these strategies to types of surge threats and offers a step-by-step guide for coordinating outbreak planning and response. Conclusions: Lack of a shared definition and decision making of surge threats had rendered the procedures somewhat duplicative. This burden was paradoxically exacerbated by a health system that highly prizes planning and forward thinking, but worked largely in silo until an ID crisis hit. Many such lessons can be put into play to further strengthen our current hospital governance and adapted to more diverse settings. © 2017 The Author(s).",Health planning and implementation; Infectious disease outbreaks; Surge capacity and capability,"clinical decision making; crowding (area); disaster planning; epidemic; hospital emergency service; hospitalization; human; infection control; medical staff; personnel management; procedures; public health; Singapore; statistics and numerical data; system analysis; utilization; Clinical Decision-Making; Crowding; Disaster Planning; Disease Outbreaks; Emergency Service, Hospital; Hospitalization; Humans; Infection Control; Medical Staff, Hospital; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Public Health; Singapore; Systems Analysis",Article

Work in the past few decades has shown that protein-based organelles called microcompartments enhance the function of encapsulated cargo proteins. More recently, the repertoire of known prokaryotic organelles has expanded beyond microcompartments to include a new class of smaller proteinaceous compartments, termed nanocompartments (also known as encapsulins). Nanocompartments are icosahedral capsids that are smaller and less complex than microcompartments. Encapsulins are formed by a single species of shell protein that self-assembles and typically encapsulates only one type of cargo protein. Significant progress has been made in understanding the structure of nanocompartment shells and the loading of cargo to the interior. Recent analysis has also demonstrated the prevalence of encapsulin genes throughout prokaryotic genomes and documented a large diversity of cargo proteins with a variety of novel functions, suggesting that nanocompartments play an important role in many microbes. Here we review the current understanding of encapsulin structure and function and highlight exciting open questions of physiological significance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",bacterial organelle; Compartmentalization; encapsulin; nanocompartment; oxidative stress,encapsulin shell protein; unclassified drug; viral protein; bacterial protein; carboxy terminal sequence; heterologous expression; molecular biology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Myxococcus xanthus; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein function; protein structure; Review; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; cell compartmentalization; cell organelle; metabolism; physiology; protein conformation; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Compartmentation; Organelles; Protein Conformation,Review

Previous studies suggested that the interaction of B cells and monocytes could promote HPAI H5N1 infection by enhancing avian influenza virus receptor expression. In this study, we further investigate the relationship between the HPAI H5N1 virus, activated B cells, and DC-SIGN expression. DC-SIGN has been described as an important factor for mediating various types of viral infection. Here, we first demonstrate that HPAI H5N1 infection could induce an activation of B cells, which was associated with DC-SIGN expression. Using CD40L and recombinant IL-4 for B cell stimulation, we determined that DC-SIGN expressed on activated B cells was able to enhance its susceptibility to HPAI H5N1 infection.

The effects of antiseptic incorporation on the stability, release of sericin, and short-term and long-term (6 months) antimicrobial activity of the sericin dressing against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were investigated. We showed that the incorporation of each antiseptic did not have significant effect on the internal morphology (pore size ~ 73–105 μm), elasticity (Young’s modulus ~ 200–500 kPa), and the sericin release behavior of the sericin-based dressing. The release of sericin from the dressing was prolonged over 120 h and thereafter. Comparing among three antiseptics, 0.05% chlorhexidine incorporated in the sericin dressing showed the highest immediate and long-term (6 months) antimicrobial effect (largest inhibition zone) against most bacteria either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. The in vivo safety test following ISO10993 standard (Biological evaluation of medical devices–Part 6: Tests for local effects after implantation) confirmed that the sericin dressing incorporating 0.05% chlorhexidine did not irritate to tissue, comparing with the commercial material used generally in clinic (Allevyn®, Smith & Nephew). We suggested the sericin dressing incorporating 0.05% chlorhexidine for the treatment of infected chronic wound. Chlorhexidine would reduce the risk of infection while the sericin may promote wound healing. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",antimicrobial; chlorhexidine; polyhexamethylene biguanide; Sericin; silver nanoparticle; wound dressing,"Bacteria; Biological materials; Biomedical equipment; Metal nanoparticles; Microorganisms; Nanoparticles; Pore size; Safety testing; antimicrobial; Chlorhexidine; Polyhexamethylene biguanide; Sericin; Silver nanoparticles; Wound dressings; Silver; chlorhexidine; poly(hexamethylenebiguanide); sericin; silver nanoparticle; antiinfective agent; biguanide derivative; chlorhexidine; drug carrier; metal nanoparticle; polihexanide; sericin; silver; Acinetobacter baumannii; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antimicrobial activity; Article; Bacillus subtilis; chronic inflammation; chronic wound; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug release; drug safety; drug stability; Escherichia coli; in vitro study; in vivo study; inhibition zone; male; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; rat; wound dressing; wound infection; Young modulus; animal; bacterium; bandage; chemistry; drug effects; drug stability; microbiology; safety; Sprague Dawley rat; wound healing; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Bandages; Biguanides; Chlorhexidine; Drug Carriers; Drug Stability; Male; Metal Nanoparticles; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Safety; Sericins; Silver; Wound Healing",Article

The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence and correlates of school truancy in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states. The analysis included 28 419 school children aged 13–15 years from seven ASEAN member states that participated in the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) between 2007 and 2013. The overall prevalence of past 30 day truancy across six ASEAN countries (excluding Brunei) was 24.8%; ranging from below 20% in Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam to more than 30% in Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, socio-demographic factors (older age, being male, the experience of hunger), externalising behaviour (tobacco use, alcohol use, having been in a physical fight, being bullied, having sustained an injury), and lack of protective social-familial factors (lack of peer support and lack of parental or guardian support) were found to be associated with truancy. High rates of truancy were found in ASEAN member states calling for interventions aimed to reduce truancy considering identified associated factors. © 2017 NISC Pty Ltd.",,adolescent; adolescent behavior; alcohol consumption; Article; Brunei Darussalam; bullying; demography; distress syndrome; female; health behavior; health survey; human; hunger; hygiene; Indonesia; major clinical study; male; mental health; Myanmar; peer group; Philippines; physical activity; sexual behavior; smoking; social psychology; Southeast Asian; student; Thailand; truancy; Viet Nam; violence,Article

However, only 3 out of 11 countries implement the comprehensive prevention program. Areas covered: This is a retrospective review from all relevant studies until 2015 from two main databases, MEDLINE/Pubmed and Embase in order to provide an evidence on the health economics of HPV vaccination in the region. Expert commentary: The implementation of HPV vaccination will generate substantial health and economic benefit in SEA countries since the number of cervical cancer cases in this region are generally high. Therefore, a clear recommendation on how HPV vaccination should be implemented in a country, for example on how many doses will be used, how much cost is required or is it a school based- or clinical based-delivery, is critically required. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",ASEAN; cost analysis; Human papillomavirus; pharmacoeconomic; Southeast Asia; vaccine,"Wart virus vaccine; Wart virus vaccine; cost effectiveness analysis; Embase; health economics; human; Medline; priority journal; retrospective study; Review; Southeast Asian; systematic review; uterine cervix cancer; vaccination; complication; cost benefit analysis; economics; female; immunology; papillomavirus infection; Southeast Asia; squamous cell carcinoma; uterine cervix tumor; vaccination; Asia, Southeastern; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Papillomavirus Infections; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaccination",Review

With a considerably expanded dataset from a large international collaboration, we aimed to estimate the global incidence, hospital admission rate, and mortality from RSV-ALRI episodes in young children in 2015. Methods We estimated the incidence and hospital admission rate of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI) in children younger than 5 years stratified by age and World Bank income regions from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2016, and unpublished data from 76 high quality population-based studies. We estimated the RSV-ALRI incidence for 132 developing countries using a risk factor-based model and 2015 population estimates. We estimated the in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality by combining in-hospital case fatality ratios with hospital admission estimates from hospital-based (published and unpublished) studies. We also estimated overall RSV-ALRI mortality by identifying studies reporting monthly data for ALRI mortality in the community and RSV activity. Findings We estimated that globally in 2015, 33·1 million (uncertainty range [UR] 21·6–50·3) episodes of RSV-ALRI, resulted in about 3·2 million (2·7–3·8) hospital admissions, and 59 600 (48 000–74 500) in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years. In children younger than 6 months, 1·4 million (UR 1·2–1·7) hospital admissions, and 27 300 (UR 20 700–36 200) in-hospital deaths were due to RSV-ALRI. We also estimated that the overall RSV-ALRI mortality could be as high as 118 200 (UR 94 600–149 400). Incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any given population. Interpretation Globally, RSV is a common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of hospital admissions in young children, resulting in a substantial burden on health-care services. About 45% of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to RSV-ALRI occur in children younger than 6 months. An effective maternal RSV vaccine or monoclonal antibody could have a substantial effect on disease burden in this age group. Funding The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. © 2017 The Author(s).

Methods: Air quality data were collected three times regarding to seasonal variation. Pollutants measured in 11 DCCs included PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3, benzene, bacteria, fungi, and dust mite. The frequencyof respiratory symptoms including coughing, rhinitis, and dyspnea were recorded via teacher and parent-report questionnaires. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) levels were measured to assess airway inflammation. Results: 436 children participated in the study. 83% completed data collection in all 3 seasons. The frequency of rhinitis correlated with PM10 (IRR=70.3, 95%CI=12.4-399.7, p&lt;0.001), CO (IRR=3.2, 95%CI=2.4-4.2, p&lt;0.001), benzene (IRR=2.3, 95%CI=1.8-3.2, p&lt;0.001) and D.Pteronyssinus level (IRR=2.1, 95%CI=1.7-2.7, p&lt;0.001). The frequency of coughingcorrelated with levels of PM10 (IRR=15.2, 95%CI=3.0-78.2, p&lt;0.001), CO (IRR=2.8, 95%CI=2.1-3.7, p&lt;0.001), benzene (IRR=1.4, 95%CI=1.1-1.9, p=0.02). The frequency of dyspnea correlated with D.Pteronyssinus level (IRR=3.9, 95%CI=1.7-9.1, p=0.001). FENO levels associated with high benzene levels (OR=5.9, 95%CI=1.5-22.9, p=0.01). The majority of DCCs had at least one PM10 measurement above the standard level, and these high levels were noted in all 3 seasons. Three DCCs had PM10 levels above the standard level in all seasons. 64% of the DCCs had indoor bacterial counts above the standard level in all seasons.

Instead of applying only CS, the pleural fluid can be further processed using the cell block (CB) technique, which may augment the diagnostic utility. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic yields of CS, CB, and the combination of both, regardless of the etiology of pleural effusion. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with pleural effusions who underwent thoracentesis from June 2015 to May 2016. All samples were submitted for routine biochemical analysis, CS, and CB histology. The results of cytopathological studies were compared to the final diagnoses. Results: Out of a total of 353 samples, the final diagnoses included 278 (78.8%) malignancies, 41 (11.6%) infectious diseases, 16 (4.5%) other inflammatory diseases, and 18 (5.1%) transudative pleural effusions. CS and CB provided a similar diagnostic yield (48.7% vs. 49.9%, P=0.69), while the combination of both gave a higher yield (57.2%) (P < 0.001, compared with CS). Among 278 malignant pleural effusions (MPE), the diagnostic yields of CS and CB were 61.2% and 61.9%, respectively. Combined CS and CB improved the diagnostic yield to 71.2% (P < 0.001). However, both CS and CB had low diagnostic yields in infectious pleuritis, other inflammatory diseases, and transudative pleural effusions. Conclusions: In MPE, CB provides a similar diagnostic performance to CS, while application of both techniques can significantly increase the diagnostic yield. However, in other pleural diseases, CB and CS had limited values in diagnosis. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.",Cell block (CB); Cytology; Malignant pleural effusion (MPE); Pleural effusion,adult; Article; bacterial infection; cell block technique; chylothorax; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cytology; cytopathology; diagnostic procedure; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; hematothorax; human; lung embolism; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; malignant pleura effusion; mycosis; non small cell lung cancer; pleura biopsy; pleura effusion; pleura empyema; pleurisy; thoracocentesis; thoracoscopy; tuberculous pleurisy,Article

In this study, an effective extraction method for sago starch production with high extraction yield and acceptable starch quality was investigated using various pretreatment techniques, that is, ultrasonic, microwave, and enzymatic pretreatments, as well as combined pretreatment methods. The sago pith slurry was pretreated before subjecting to the normal process of sago starch extraction. The extracted sago starch was analyzed for extraction yield and physicochemical properties. Sago pith had high starch content of 82.0% (db). The highest extraction yields obtained using ultrasonic, microwave, enzymatic, and combined ultrasonic–enzymatic pretreatment methods were 71.5, 63.7, 71.4, and 72.5%, respectively, while the control method (without pretreatment) provided 61.0% extraction yield. The peak viscosity and color L* value of all extracted sago starches met the requirements of edible sago starch. Concerning the effective pretreatment method in terms of reduced time and energy consumption, while providing high extraction yield and acceptable starch quality, the ultrasonic pretreatment was recommended. The highest yielding ultrasonic pretreatment conditions were found to be 10% w/w sago pith slurry, 160 W power input, and 7 min pretreatment time. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Material and Method: Between January 2007 and December 2014, 38 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations in 38 DTC patients with elevated sTg levels (10 ng/ml or greater, n = 33) or elevated TgAb levels (40.0 IU/ml or greater, n = 5) but negative post-therapeutic 131I WBS or diagnostic 131I WBS were included. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation. The 18F-FDG PET/CT findings were compared with histologic (n = 16) or clinical follow-up results based on serum Tg/TgAb levels or other imaging modalities. Duration of follow-up ranged from six months to seven years (median duration = 30 months). Results: Thirty-two studies showed true positive lesions of local recurrence (n = 23, 60.5%), distant metastases (n = 2, 5.3%) and both local recurrence and distant metastases (n = 7, 18.4%). One study (2.6%) was considered as false positive lesions at cervical nodes, which was confirmed by histological result. Four studies (10.5%) were confirmed true negative results. A patient with no abnormal 18F-FDG avidity in subcentimeter cervical lymph nodes was clarified as false negative, as subsequent follow-up results showed slow rising of Tg levels with suggestion of cervical node metastases demonstrated by neck ultrasonography. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the present study were 96.9%, 80%, and 94.7%, respectively. Additional information of previously undiagnosed lesions was found in seven patients i.e., meningioma and metastatic lesions in brain, bone, liver, muscle, and soft tissue. Conclusion: The 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for detection and localization of recurrence or metastases in DTC patients with negative 131I WBS but elevated sTg or TgAb levels. This technique also provides useful additional findings for appropriate management of these patients. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

This study aimed to determine the need to revaccinate perinatally HIV-infected Thai adolescents. Methods: Cross-sectional serologic tests for HBV, including hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) and anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), were performed in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents. Adolescents having anti-HBs <100 mIU/mL with negative anti-HBc and immune reconstitution from highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were revaccinated using regular (10 μg) 3-dose schedule given intramuscularly at 0-, 2- and 6-month intervals. Results: Of 193 adolescents who received 3-dose infant HBV vaccination, 6 were receiving HAART during vaccination, median (interquartile range) current age 14.5 (11.7-16.2) years, 7 (3.6%) had positive anti-HBc (indicating breakthrough infection), of which 4 (2%) had positive hepatitis B surface antigen (indicating chronic infection). Twenty-two (11.4%) adolescents had protective anti-HBs concentration >10 mIU/mL. Of 164 revaccinated adolescents, 142 (86.6%) had HIV viral load <40 copies/mL. Anti-HBs seroconversion rates >10 mIU/mL were 58.0% (94/162) after the first dose and 97.5% (158/162) after the third dose of revaccination. Forty-five (28%) subjects responded to the first dose with anti-HBs antibody ≥100 mIU/mL had a shorter median duration with CD4 count <15% than their counterparts (6.2 vs. 11.1 months; P = 0.049). Conclusions: Only half of perinatally HIV-infected adolescents were able to elicit anti-HBs response with a single-dose HBV vaccine. Revaccination with 3-dose schedule is required in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents who did not initiate HAART at the time of infant vaccination. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In transferring colors between images, there are several issues needed to be considered including partial color transfer, trial-And-error, and multiple target color transfer. Our approach enables users to transfer colors partially and locally by letting users select their regions of interest from image segmentation. Since there are many ways that we can transfer colors from a set of target regions to a set of source regions, we introduce the region exploration and navigation approach where users can choose their preferred color tones to transfer one region at a time and gradually customize towards their desired results. The preferred color tones sometimes can come from more than one image; therefore our method is extended to allow users to select their preferred color tones from multiple images. Our experimental results have shown the flexibility of our approach to generate reasonable segmented regions of interest and to enable users to explore the possible results more conveniently.

Approximately 3 weeks after the oil spill, leaves of T. catappa were collected along the coastline of Rayong from one affected site, five adjacent sites, and a control site. Slides of the leaf epidermis were prepared by the peeling method, while leaf and petiole transverse sections were prepared by paraffin embedding. Cell walls of adaxial epidermal cell on leaves in the affected site were straight instead of the jigsaw shape found in leaves from the adjacent and control sites. In addition, the stomatal index of the abaxial leaf surface was significantly lower in the affected site. Leaf and petiole transverse sections collected from the affected site showed increased cuticle thickness, epidermal cell diameter on both sides, and palisade mesophyll thickness; in contrast, vessel diameter and spongy mesophyll thickness were reduced.

The experimental design was to evaluate the effects of two independent variables: (1) AgNO3 content (X1) and (2) DMF content (X2) on the measured responses, i.e., the %reduction of Escherichia coli (Y1, %), %reduction of Staphylococcus aureus (Y2, %), and the color differences of nanocomposites (Y3, ΔE*). The formation of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) in UV-curable PU matrix was determined by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Statistical analyses indicated the empirical second-order polynomial can accurately describe the %reduction of E. coli, %reduction of S. aureus, and color difference values. The 3D response surface graphs showed that the optimal contents of AgNO3 and DMF were 0.3 and 36.0 phr, respectively. We have demonstrated that RSM can be used to determine the optimal conditions for in situ synthesis of AgNPs in a UV-curable PU matrix for the development of self-disinfecting coatings. Therefore, the application of RSM for determining optimal formulations for self-disinfecting coatings with excellent antibacterial activities and minimal color changes is effective and practical. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Antibacterial activity; Central composite design; Response surface methodology; Silver nanoparticles; UV curable polyurethane,Absorption spectroscopy; Bacteria; Coatings; Color; Colorimetry; Curing; Escherichia coli; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Scanning electron microscopy; Silver; Surface properties; X ray diffraction; Anti-bacterial activity; Central composite designs; Response surface methodology; Silver nanoparticles; UV curable; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,Article

We evaluated the feasibility of central venous lactate (cvLact) in assessing aLact among children with shock. Methods Pairs of arterial and central venous samples for lactate concentrations were collected simultaneously during the shock and hemodynamically stable states. The results were analyzed by using a Cobas 8000 analyzer. Results Sixty-four blood paired samples were collected from 48 patients. The overall correlation between central venous and arterial lactate concentrations was r = 0.962, p &lt; 0.0001, r2 = 0.965. The regression equation was aLact = (0.978 × cvLact) − 0.137. A similar correlation was found between central venous and arterial lactate concentrations during the states of shock and stable hemodynamics (r = 0.970, p &lt; 0.0001, r2 = 0.966 and r = 0.935, p &lt; 0.0001, r2 = 0.962, respectively). The mean difference between central venous and arterial lactate concentrations was 0.20 mmol/l (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.32) and the limits of agreement were − 0.74 mmol/l (95% CI: − 0.94 to − 0.53) and 1.13 (95% CI: 0.93 to 1.34).

However, functional significance of those datasets in diabetic nephropathy remained unclear. We thus performed integrative proteome network analysis of such datasets followed by various targeted functional studies in distal renal tubular cells treated with high glucose (HG) (25 mM) compared to normal glucose (NG) (5.5 mM) and NG + mannitol (M) (5.5 + 19.5 mM). The data showed that at 96 h when cell proliferation/death, tight junction protein and β-/F-actin expression and organization, and transepithelial resistance remained unchanged, only HG caused increased levels of HSP90, HSP70, and HSP60, and increased accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates. In addition, HG also induced overproduction of intracellular ROS, decreased catalase level, increased level of oxidatively modified proteins, increased intracellular ATP level, and defective transepithelial Ca2+ transport. However, both HG and M increased the levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Taken together, this study demonstrated significant perturbations of distal renal tubular cells induced by HG based on targeted functional studies guided by integrative proteome network analysis. These data may, at least in part, lead to better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of diabetic nephropathy. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The promiscuity of Pgp that arises from its ability to extrude a wide range of lipophilic and structurally unrelated compounds from cells, render the classification and understanding of its interacting compounds a great challenge. Method: In this study, a data set of Pgp-interacting compounds including 1463 inhibitors, 1085 noninhibitors, 308 substrates and 126 non-substrates was retrieved and subjected to a combination of analyses, including exploration of chemical space, statistical analysis of descriptor values and molecular fragment analysis, to obtain insight into distinct physicochemical properties and important chemical substructures which may govern the biological activity of investigated compounds toward Pgp. Statistical analysis of descriptor values and molecular fragment analysis indicated that particular size, shape, functional groups and molecular fragments may govern the classification of Pgp-interacting compounds by influencing their physicochemical properties and their interaction with Pgp. Overall, the interacting compounds (i.e., substrates and inhibitors) are larger in size, more flexible, more lipophilic, and less charged than non-interacting compounds (i.e., non-substrates and non-inhibitors). Conclusion: The fragment analysis suggested that methyl and amino groups may be involved in Pgp inhibition and/or transport. The 2-methoxyphenol fragment was noted to be a potential substructure for designing Pgp inhibitors, whereas the 2-sulfanylidene-1-[3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carbonitrile substructure was implied for avoiding transport by Pgp. Hence, this study could provide a comprehensive understanding of this drug transporter, which could benefit an early ADMET screening as well as drug design and development. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.",ADMET; Chemical space; Molecular substructure analysis; P-glycoprotein; Physicochemical properties; Promiscuity,"benzene derivative; inhibitor protein; multidrug resistance protein; peptide fragment; guaiacol; multidrug resistance protein; Article; bioinformatics; biological activity; chemical bond; chemical phenomena; chemical space; chemical structure; dipole; energy; lipophilicity; molecular interaction; molecular weight; particle size; partition coefficient; physical chemistry; process optimization; protein transport; surface charge; surface property; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; drug effects; human; multidrug resistance; structure activity relation; Drug Resistance, Multiple; Guaiacol; Humans; Molecular Structure; P-Glycoproteins; Structure-Activity Relationship",Article

Material and Method: A prospective controlled study of intubation in 224 adults, half were intubated using RSI and half non-RSI. Patients’ demographic details, indication for intubation, intubation technique, decision-to-tube time, open mouth-to-tube time, number of attempts, and immediate complications were recorded. Results: The median open mouth-to-tube time was significantly lower in the RSI group (65 seconds [interquartile range, IQR 44 to 92 seconds] vs. 127 seconds [IQR 70 to 274 seconds], p<0.01), but there was no difference in the median decision-to-tube time (412 seconds [IQR 354 to 506 seconds] in the RSI group compared with 420 seconds [IQR 265 to 566 seconds] in the non-RSI group, p = 0.46). Intubation success rate was significantly higher in the RSI group (83.9% compared with 54.5%, p<0.01), and was superior even for less experienced intubators. The incidence of immediate complications was significantly lower in the RSI group (42.0%) than the non-RSI group (56.2%, p = 0.04). Conclusion: Using RSI significantly reduced the time from laryngoscopy to confirmation of intubation, improved success rate, and reduced the incidence of complications compared with non-RSI techniques.

Methods: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, ScienceDirect®, Proquest, Web of Science®, LILACS, NAPRALERT, SciFinder, Clinicalkey, Herbmed, NCCIH and Google Scholar were searched from their earliest inception up to March 2017 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared dragon fruit with placebo or no treatment in prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Clinicaltrials.gov, clinicaltrialresults.org, and ISRCTN registry were also searched. Personal contact with experts and historical search of related articles was undertaken. Outcome of interest were fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2 hours post-prandial glucose (2HPP). Study selection, data extraction and study quality assessment were performed independently by two investigators. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. Treatment effect was estimated with mean difference (MD). Effect estimates were pooled using inverse-variance weighted method. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Q statistic and quantified with the I2 statistic. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used when the Q-statistic was significant at the level of 0.1, otherwise a fixed-effects model was used. Results: Among 401 studies identified from literature search, 4 RCTs involving 36 prediabetes subjects and 109 type 2 diabetes patients were included in the analysis. In prediabetes, FPG reduction was significant with MD of -15.1 mg/dL (95% CI: -23.8 to -6.5 mg/dL, P-value = 0.0006). Meta-analysis in type 2 diabetes showed no effect of dragon fruit on FPG (MD -26.5 mg/dL, 95% CI: -72.6 mg/dL to 19.6 mg/dL) and in 2HPP (MD -30.5 mg/dL, 95% CI: -80.9 mg/dL to 19.9 mg/dL). Conclusion: The available evidence in prediabetes is interesting. This will shed some light on diabetes prevention. The effect in T2DM was not significant. However, a trend towards greater blood glucose reduction with higher dose was observed. © 2017 Poolsup et al.

Scopolamine has been employed to induce Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology in vivo and in vitro through alteration of cholinergic system. N-benzylcinnamide (PT-3), purified from Piper submultinerve, has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective properties against amyloid-β-induced neuronal toxicity in rat cortical primary cell culture and to improve spatial learning and memory of aged rats through alleviating oxidative stress. We proposed a hypothesis that PT3 has a neuroprotective effect against scopolamine-induced cholinergic dysfunction. PT-3 (125-200 nM) pretreatment was performed in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line following scopolamine induction. PT-3 (125-200 nM) inhibited scopolamine (2 mM)-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, cellular apoptosis, upregulation of acetylcholinesterase activity, downregulation of choline acetyltransferase level, and activation of p38 and JNK signalling pathways. These findings revealed the underlying mechanisms of scopolamine-induced Alzheimer’s disease-like cellular dysfunctions, which provide evidence for developing drugs for the treatment of this debilitating disease. © 2017, Medknow Publications.

The objective of this study was to define normal FENO levels in healthy Thai volunteers. Method: This prospective cohort study was conducted in healthy Thai volunteers aged ≥5 years. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and pulmonary function test (PFT) was performed. FENO was measured using a chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyzer. Results: Seventy-nine healthy Thai volunteers with normal lung function test were included. Mean age of participants was 13 (6-47) years and 58.2% were female. All subjects had no history of allergic respiratory diseases. Mean FENO level increased with age, and the differences between age groups were statistically significant (p=0.001). The highest mean FENO level was 13.6 ppb in the 11-15 year age group, and then the FENO level gradually declined with age. The highest mean FENO level was found in the 18-24.9 body mass index (BMI) group. Significant differences were observed for FENO levels between different height groups (p=0.005) but not between different BMI groups (p=0.46). Fair correlations between FENO levels and body weight, height, FEV1, and FVC were observed. A fair correlation between FENO level and age, FENO level and FEF25%-75% was found only in volunteers ≤15 years of age. Conclusions: FENO level in healthy Thais increased with age until reaching maximum level (mean FENO 13.6 ppb) in the 11-15 year age group. Significant differences were observed for FENO levels between different age groups and different height groups. © 2017, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

Material and Method: A retrospective review of all chronic urticaria patients attending the Urticaria Clinic who underwent ASST and APST between January 2010 and March 2014 was conducted. The data on their demography, disease severity, and results of ASST, APST, and other relevant tests were collected and analyzed using a statistical software. Results: Seventy-nine patients, comprising 14 (17.7%) males and 65 (82.3%) females, were included in the present study. Their median (range) age was 37 years (18 to 73 years). The median (range) duration of the disease was two years (2 months to 30 years). ASST was positive in 48 patients (60.8%) whereas APST was positive in 50 patients (63.3%). The difference in prevalence between both tests was not statistically significant (p = 0.593). A statistically significant association with higher number of wheals during each attack of urticarial symptoms was found in ASST-positive group (p<0.001), but not in APST-positive group (p = 0.064). Conclusion: ASST and APST can similarly detect autoreactivity in Thai chronic urticaria patients. Thus APST, the less established test between the two, is unnecessary. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

However, there are scarce studies in the literature that have evaluated the safety and the efficacy of an ant RIT process in children. Objective: To evaluate the safety and the efficacy of an ant RIT protocol and to identify the risk factors for systemic reactions (SRs) during an RIT procedure in children. Method: A retrospective review was conducted for those children who were receiving an ant RIT procedure. The 3-day RIT protocol consisted of hourly subcutaneous injections in order to achieve a 0.5 ml maintenance dose of a 1:100 weight/ volume (wt/vol) of the Solenopsis invicta whole body extract. The safety for an RIT procedure was monitored by using the World Allergy Organization Subcutaneous Immunology Systemic Reaction Grading System. The efficacy was assessed by the reactions after a field ant re-sting. Results: A total of 20 children who were receiving an ant RIT therapy were reviewed. The mean age was 9.5±3.07 years. There were 6 systemic reactions (SRs) from 324 injections during the RIT procedure (1.85%). All of the systemic reactions were Grade 1-2. There were no associations of SRs regarding age, gender, an atopic history, or the levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization to the ants. Among the 14 patients who experienced a field ant re-sting, 4 (28.5%) patients developed Grade 3 SRs. These Grade 3 reactions were resolved after an increase of the maintenance dose to 0.5 ml of a 1:50 wt/vol. There was a significant difference in the mean age of those children who had ant re-sting systemic reactions and those who had no reactions (6.75±0.95 year vs. 10.8±3.29, p=0.036). Conclusions: Rush immunotherapy with ant in children is safe and it has a low occurrence of severe systemic reactions.
