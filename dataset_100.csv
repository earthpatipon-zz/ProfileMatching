Although mature reticulocytes can be efficiently generated by such systems, the numbers produced fall short of that required for therapeutics, due to limited proliferative capacity of the erythroblasts. To overcome this hurdle, approaches are required to increase the expansion potential of such culture systems. The OP9 mouse stromal cell line is known to promote haematopoietic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, however an effect of OP9 cells on erythropoiesis has not been explored. In this study, we show not only OP9 co-culture, but factors secreted by OP9 cells in isolation increase the proliferative potential of adult erythroid cells by delaying differentiation and hence maintaining self-renewing cells for an extended duration. The number of reticulocytes obtained was increased by approximately 3.5-fold, bringing it closer to that required for a therapeutic product. To identify the factors responsible, we analysed the OP9 cell secretome using comparative proteomics, identifying 18 candidate proteins. These data reveal the potential to increase erythroid cell numbers from in vitro culture systems without the need for genetic manipulation or co-culture. © 2018 The Author(s).",,adult; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell count; coculture; differentiation; erythroid cell; erythropoiesis; female; genetic manipulation; male; mouse; nonhuman; OP9 cell line; pluripotent stem cell; proteomics; reticulocyte; stromal cell line,Article

Usually in advanced malignant stages, TGF-β signaling is elevated but global miRNA expression is suppressed. Such a gene expression signature is well illustrated in a fibrosis (or mesenchymal) subtype of ovarian cancer (OC) that is of poor prognosis. However, the interplay between the two pathways in the OC subtype has not yet been elucidated. nc886 is a recently identified non-coding RNA implicated in several malignancies. The high expression of nc886 is associated with poor prognosis in 285 OC patients. Herein, we find that in OC nc886 expression is induced by TGF-β and that nc886 binds to Dicer to inhibit miRNA maturation. By preventing the miRNA pathway, nc886 emulates TGF-β in gene expression patterns and potentiates cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and drug resistance. Here we report nc886 to be a molecular link between the TGF-β and miRNA pathways. © 2018 The Author(s).",,cancer; gene expression; genetic engineering; induced response; RNA,Article

However, actual knowledge regarding the effect of plant-bacteria interactions on enhancing BPA removal is still lacking. In the present study, Dracaena sanderiana endophytic bacteria interactions were investigated to evaluate the effect of bacterial inoculation on BPA removal under hydroponic conditions. Two plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacterial strains, Bacillus thuringiensis and Pantoea dispersa, which have high BPA tolerance and can utilize BPA for growth, were used as plant inocula. P. dispersa-inoculated plants showed the highest BPA removal efficiency at 92.32 ± 1.23% compared to other inoculated and non-inoculated plants. This was due to a higher population of the endophytic inoculum within the plant tissues which resulted in maintained levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) for the plant's physiological needs and lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, B. thuringiensis-inoculated plants had a lower BPA removal efficiency. However, individual B. thuringiensis possessed a significantly higher BPA removal efficiency compared to P. dispersa. This study provides convincing evidence that not all PGP endophytic bacteria-plant interactions could improve the BPA removal efficiency. Different inocula and inoculation times should be investigated before using plant inoculation to enhance phytoremediation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Bacillus thuringiensis; Bisphenol A; Dracaena sanderiana; Endophytic bacteria; Pantoea dispersa,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; indoleacetic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; angiosperm; endocrine disruptor; endophyte; hydroponics; inoculation; phytoremediation; Article; Bacillus thuringiensis; bacterial strain; controlled study; Dracaena; Dracaena sanderiana; endophyte; hydroponics; inoculation; microbial activity; nonhuman; Pantoea; Pantoea dispersa; phytoremediation; plant growth; plant microorganism interaction; plant physiology; plant tissue; waste component removal; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Dracaena sanderiana; Pantoea dispersa",Article

The aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity in genes potentially linked to drug resistance in P. vivax parasites isolated from four different border regions of Thailand; Thai-Myanmar (Tak, Mae Hong Son and Prachuap Khiri Khan Provinces), and Thai-Cambodian borders (Chanthaburi Province). Isolates were collected from 345 P. vivax patients in 2008 and 2014, and parasite DNA extracted and subjected to nucleotide sequencing at five putative drug-resistance loci (Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1, Pvcrt-o and Pvk12). The prevalence of mutations in Pvdhfr, Pvdhps and Pvmdr1 were markedly different between the Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodian border areas and also varied between sampling times. All isolates carried the Pvdhfr (58R and 117N/T) mutation, however, whereas the quadruple mutant allele (I57R58M61T117) was the most prevalent (69.6%) in the Thai-Myanmar border region, the double mutant allele (F57R58T61N117) was at fixation on the Thai-Cambodian border (100%). The most prevalent genotypes of Pvdhps and Pvmdr1 were the double mutant (S382G383K512G553) (65.1%) and single mutant (M958Y976F1076) (46.5%) alleles, respectively on the Thai-Myanmar border while the single Pvdhps mutant (S382G383K512A553) (52.7%) and the triple Pvmdr1 mutant (M958F976L1076) (81%) alleles were dominant on the Thai-Cambodian border. No mutations were observed in the Pvcrt-o gene in either region.

In this study, the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was evaluated for the reliability of model calibration and validation procedures using local-scale data. The model was then employed to evaluate the possible impact of climate change on rice yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in Roi Et Province, Northeast Thailand. The dominant factors that influence the changes in rice yield and SOC sequestration were identified. Four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and Sixteen General Circulation Models under four future time periods; near future (2020–2039), mid future (2040–2059), far future (2060–2079), and very far future (2080–2099) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used as future climate projections. The findings revealed that climate change will impact rice yields positively, which will benefit farmers, especially in rain-fed areas, by +2.6% (RCP8.5: 2080–2099) to +22.7% (RCP6.0: 2080–2099). Rice yields in all case tend to increase significantly by +0.7% (RCP8.5: 2060–2079) to +18.8% (RCP6.0: 2080–2099), with the exception of 2080–2099 under RCP8.5, which results in a decline of rice yield by −8.4%. The precipitation is the most important factor for rice yield in this area. Although rising temperatures will bring a slight rice yield reduction, its impact will be negated by large amounts of increased CO2 concentration and precipitation. Conversely, SOC decreased significantly in all time periods. The highest decreased SOC was a -32.0% decline under RCP8.5 in the very far future. This is because rises in temperature and precipitation, with precipitation being the most important driver, negated the enrichment of CO2 fertilization, resulting in accelerated SOC decomposition rates, which may increase nitrogen availability to the soil and increase yield. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change; EPIC model; Rice; Soil organic carbon; Thailand,agrometeorology; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); crop yield; food security; general circulation model; model validation; soil organic matter; soil quality; Northeastern Region; Roi Et; Thailand,Article

In this study, we report the first polymer-anticancer drug conjugate with poly(glycerol adipate) (PGA) through the successful conjugation of methotrexate (MTX). MTX-PGA conjugates were controllably and simply fabricated by carbodiimide-mediated coupling reaction with various high molar ratios of MTX. The MTX-PGA conjugate self-assembled into nanoparticles with size dependent on the amount of conjugated MTX and the pH of medium. Change in particle size was attributed to steric hindrance and bulkiness inside the nanoparticle core and dissociation of free functional groups of the drug. The MTX-PGA nanoparticles were physically stable in media with pH range of 5–9 and ionic strength of up to 0.15 M NaCl and further chemically stable against hydrolysis in pH 7.4 medium over 30 days but enzymatically degradable to release unchanged free drug. Although 30%MTX-PGA nanoparticles exhibited only slightly less potency than free MTX in 791T cells in contrast to previously reported human serum albumin-MTX conjugates which had >300 times lower potency than free MTX. However, the MTX nanoparticles showed 7 times higher toxicity to Saos-2 cells than MTX. Together with the enzymic degradation experiments, these results suggest that with a suitable biodegradable polymer a linker moiety is not a necessary component. These easily synthesised PGA drug conjugates lacking a linker moiety could therefore be an effective new pathway for development of polymer drug conjugates. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Methotrexate; Nanoparticle; Osteosarcoma cell; Poly(glycerol adipate); Polymer-drug conjugate,Biodegradable polymers; Chemical reactions; Glycerol; Ionic strength; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Sodium chloride; Targeted drug delivery; Adipates; Anti-cancer drug delivery; Enzymic degradation; Human serum albumins; Methotrexate; Methotrexate (MTX); Osteosarcoma cells; Polymer drugs; Controlled drug delivery; cyanamide; human serum albumin; methotrexate; poly(glycerol adipate); polymer; unclassified drug; Article; controlled study; cross coupling reaction; drug conjugation; drug delivery system; drug hydrolysis; drug potency; drug synthesis; human; human cell; ionic strength; nanofabrication; particle size; pH; priority journal; SaOS-2 cell line,Article

Mineral ion loaded HAFS was successfully converted into mHAFS via the hydrothermal heating of HAFS in a SBF (simulated body fluid) solution. The composite mHAFS with PLAChi showed a compressive strength of 20 MPa and a compressive modulus of 539.88 MPa with a microporous structure. In vitro investigation showed that the UMR-106 cells adhered well and proliferated on the mHAFS@PLAChi surface. Most importantly it improved the cell viability and alkaline phosphate (ALP) activity.

This 10-year period study investigated the prevalence of CD in Thailand, and the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Thai CD patients, with special focus on the existence and prevalence of TAFRO syndrome. TAFRO syndrome is defined as CD with thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly. Thirty-three CD patients diagnosed and treated at Siriraj Hospital during January 2007 to December 2016 were included. The prevalence of CD was 1.4 per 1,000,000 patients/10 years. Median age was 46 years, with slight female predominance. Six patients were assigned to the TAFRO group. A high proportion of TAFRO syndrome (18.2%) was found among Thai adult CD patients. In addition to routine TAFRO diagnostic criteria, significantly lower hemoglobin and albumin levels were observed in the TAFRO group than in the non-TAFRO group. Treatment outcomes of CD patients were complete remission (52%), stable disease (30%), and death (13%). Three-year overall survival in the non-TAFRO group and TAFRO group was 88 and 50%, respectively. While most CD patients had a good prognosis, severe cases with TAFRO syndrome had poor outcome. © 2018, The Author(s).",Ascites; Castleman’s disease; Lymphadenopathy; Pleural effusion; TAFRO syndrome,"antineoplastic agent; adult; angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia; ascites; edema; female; fever; follow up; human; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; pleura effusion; prevalence; prognosis; remission; severity of illness index; survival analysis; teaching hospital; Thailand; thrombocytopenia; Adult; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Ascites; Castleman Disease; Edema; Female; Fever; Follow-Up Studies; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Lost to Follow-Up; Male; Middle Aged; Pleural Effusion; Prevalence; Prognosis; Remission Induction; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Thailand; Thrombocytopenia",Article

A pot experiment was carried out by transplanting Napier grass with and without bacterial inoculation in cadmium contaminated soil for 6 months. The results found that Micrococcus sp. significantly promoted the shoot biomass of Napier grass but not the root biomass. Micrococcus sp. and Arthrobacter sp. stimulated cadmium accumulation in the root and the shoot. Cadmium was retained more in the root than the shoot at all plantation periods. The maximum cadmium content in a whole plant was found in plants inoculated with Micrococcus sp. at six months. The values of phytoextraction coefficient and bioaccumulation factor in plants with bacterial inoculation were higher than those in the uninoculated control. Translocation factor was very low. Napier grass could be considered as a candidate plant for cadmium phytostabilization. The calorific value of Napier grass transplanted in cadmium-contaminated soil was similar to that in uncontaminated soil, but cadmium was still retained in the ash and some was emitted into the air. In conclusion, these cadmium-resistant bacteria enhanced the performance of Napier grass on cadmium phytoremediation.

Yet empirical evidence is limited outside of western societies, which have different household structures, work styles, and socio-cultural constructions of the practice. This study examined frequencies of family commensality based on 242 surveys of Japanese adults aged between 20 and 85 in two metropolitan areas. Results showed that family commensality is less frequent not only among those living alone, but also among those living with only non-partners including adult children, parents, and non-family members, than among those living with partners. Full-time employment was associated with late dinner times on weekdays. Later weekday dinner times were strongly associated with reduced frequency of dinners together. Late dinners have become commonplace among full-time workers in postwar Japan, and the peak dinner time in Japan occurs later than in other developed countries. Thus, work and lifestyle constraints impacting schedules appear to influence the frequency of family commensality. Our results suggest that frequencies of family commensality are influenced by co-residents and work styles of participants rather than household sizes. The idea that reduction of household size drives reduction of family commensality may be biased by previous studies conducted in western countries where most people reside in either single or nuclear households. Our study highlights complex determinants of family commensality, beyond presence of other household members, and demonstrates a need for rigorous investigation of family commensality across cultures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,adult; adult child; aged; article; child; developed country; female; full time employment; household; human; human experiment; Japan; Japanese (citizen); lifestyle; major clinical study; male; resident; worker,Article

PLA was presented as a substrate to stimulate production of protease and PLA-degrading enzyme by S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3. The optimal pH values for both protease and PLA-degrading enzyme production by S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. The optimal gelatin concentrations for stimulating protease production in S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 0.3% (w/v), while those for PLA-degrading enzyme production in S. pavanii CH1 and P. geniculata WS3 were 0.1 and 0.3% (w/v), respectively. In addition, P. geniculata WS3 had a higher percentage of PLA film-weight loss than that of S. pavanii CH1, corresponding with reduced molecular weight of PLA.

Curcuminoid substances has been reported to have benefits in treating dental chronic infection and inflammation diseases, such as chronic periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to find the optimum concentration of Curcuma longa (CL) extract, containing all curcuminoid substances, and the power density of blue light (BL) in photodynamic therapy against periodontally pathogenic bacteria, A. actinomycetemcomitans. Methods: Antibacterial activity of various concentrations of CL extract against A. actinomycetemcomitans was determined. Exponentially growing bacteria were combined with 2-fold dilution of CL extract solution ranging from 25 to 0.098 μg/ml. Co-culture bacteria treated with 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) served as the positive control. The effect of photostimulation with light emitting diode (LED) 420–480 nm at 16.8 J/cm2 for 1 min on the selected concentration of CL extract was examined. Bacteria viability was determined by plate counting technique. In addition, production of free radicals was tested by electron spin resonance spectroscope (ESR) with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). Results: The antibacterial activity of CL extract was dose dependent. Without BL, 25 μg/ml CL extract showed 6.03 ± 0.39 log10 A. actinomycetemcomitans. Interestingly, the combination of BL and 0.78 μg/ml CL extract solution showed complete absence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Peak signal intensity of hydroxyl radical production was also detected with the combination of BL and CL. Conclusions: CL extract not only had antimicrobial activity but also could be used as an effective PS when stimulated with BL in PDT. The optimal antibacterial effect of CL extract with BL was equal to the standard oral disinfectant, 0.12% CHX. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; Curcuma longa extract; Natural photosensitizer; Photodynamic therapy,"5,5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline 1 oxide; chlorhexidine; Curcuma longa extract; hydroxyl radical; Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterial count; bacterial viability; bacterium culture; blue light; coculture; concentration response; controlled study; dilution; electron spin resonance; nonhuman; photodynamic therapy; photostimulation; plate count; priority journal",Article

To address this problem, we here report the first demonstration of an EnFC using a variant of pyranose-2-oxidase (P2O-T169G) which has been shown to have low activity towards oxygen. A simple and biocompatible immobilisation approach incorporating multi-walled-carbon nanotubes within ferrocene (Fc)-Nafion film was implemented to construct EnFCs. Successful immobilisation of the enzymes was demonstrated showing 3.2 and 1.7-fold higher current than when P2O-T169G and GOx were used in solution, respectively. P2O-T169G showed 25% higher power output (maximum power density value of 8.45 ± 1.6 μW cm−2) and better stability than GOx in aerated glucose solutions.

The device was fabricated from a cotton thread (15 cm) treated with indicator solution, providing an easy-to-use platform for rapid measurement of analyte concentration in aqueous solution. The thread was immobilized onto a support, being a polypropylene sheet or box platform, to facilitate loading of liquid samples. Interaction between the deposited reagents and analytes in the samples then occurred within a few minutes. This resulted in zones of color change with different lengths along the thread depending on the analyte concentration. The interaction zones can be analyzed by human eyes based on comparison of the zone lengths with the printed scales which are correlated with the analyte concentrations. Complexometric titration using µTADs was initially investigated for Mg(II) determination in water and rubber latex samples. These devices consisted of two threads which were pretreated with Eriochrome Black T (EBT) and then treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer at pH 10. Both threads were tied together with a central knot before being attached to the box platform prior to the analysis. Load of sample solution (6 µL) resulted in the length of red-violet color product on the threads being proportional to the concentration of Mg(II) in waters and rubber latex samples with the working concentration range of 25–1000 mg L−1. In addition, µTAD with a supporting polypropylene sheet consisting of several threads treated with AgNO3 and K2CrO4 indicators was applied for argentometric titration of chloride ion in water and food seasoning samples. After sample loading (3 µL), the initially red-brown threads turned into white corresponding to formation of AgCl(s) on the threads with a working concentration range of 75–600 mg L−1. Greater selectivity towards Mg(II) and chloride compared with potential interference ions was also observed. All the developed μTADs were applied for analysis of real samples which showed results being in agreement with those obtained by classical titrations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Argentometric titration; Chloride; Complexometric titration; Magnesium (Mg(II)); Microfluidic thread-based analytical device (µTAD),Analytic equipment; Chlorine compounds; Chromium compounds; Color; Colorimetry; Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; Latexes; Microfluidics; Polypropylenes; Potassium compounds; Reinforced plastics; Rubber; Rubber thread; Silver compounds; Solutions; Titration; Volumetric analysis; Analyte concentration; Analytical approach; Chloride; Complexometric titration; Concentration ranges; Eriochrome black T; Polypropylene sheets; Potential interferences; Magnesium compounds,Article

Although most human infection cases are asymptomatic, approximately one in 150 infected individuals develops meningoencephalitis, with a mortality rate of 4–14%. While the development of human neutralizing antibody therapeutics against WNV is strongly anticipated, WNV is difficult to study in conventional laboratories due to its high safety level requirement. In this study, we established fully human WNV-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of inactivated-JEV-vaccinated individuals, and these antibodies exhibited WNV neutralization both in vitro and in vivo.

The pharmacokinetics for LEV in neonatal populations is yet to be clearly understood. In this study, we developed and validated a method for determination of LEV in plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for the purpose of pharmacokinetic study. Methods: Plasma LEV was spiked with Lamivudine as internal standard before extraction by C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. Chromatography was performed using isocratic elution with mobile phase A: B (10: 90) for 2.0 min with flow rate 0.4 mL/min. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% formic acid in 10.0 mM ammonium acetate (A) and 100% methanol (B). The injection volume was 1.0 μL and the total run time was 2.0 min. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with electro spray in positive mode was used. The mass transition for LEV was 171.2/126.0 and 230.0/112.0 for IS with retention time of 0.73 and 0.72 min, respectively. Results: A calibration curve range from 0.50–80.0 μg/mL was obtained with a correlation coefficient >0.99 in the quadratic model. Precision and accuracy was within the acceptable range and the intra- and inter-day %CV for three concentrations of QCs were <10%. Conclusion: This method was reliable, accurate and applicable for LEV pharmacokinetic study in neonates with seizure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Levetiracetam; Liquid chromatography; Neonates; Pharmacokinetics; Tandem mass spectrometry,Extraction; Liquid chromatography; Liquids; Mass spectrometry; Pharmacokinetics; Phase separation; Correlation coefficient; Levetiracetam; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Multiple reaction monitoring; Neonates; Pharmacokinetic studies; Solid phase extraction cartridges; Tandem mass spectrometry; High pressure liquid chromatography,Article

Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, Thailand","It was previously shown that the seasonal H1N1 influenza virus antigenic drift occurred at a slower rate than the seasonal H3N2 virus during the first decade of the 21th century. It was hypothesized that the slower antigenic evolution led to a decrease in average ages of infection, which in turn resulted in lower level of global viral circulation. It is unclear what caused the difference between the two viruses, but a plausible explanation may be related to the fact that the H1N1 virus had been in human population for much longer than the H3N2 virus. This would suggest that H1N1 antigenic drift in an earlier period may have been different from a more recent period. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed seasonal H1N1 influenza sequences during various time periods. In comparison to more recent H1N1 virus, the older H1N1 virus during the first half of the 20th century showed evidences of higher nonsynnonymous/synonymous ration (dN/dS) in its hemagglutinin (HA) gene. We compared amino acid sequence changes in the HA epitopes for each outbreak season and found that there were less changes in later years. Amino acid sequence diversity in the epitopes as measured by sequence entropy became smaller for each passing decade. These suggest that there might be some limit to the antigenic drift. The longer an influenza virus has drifted in human population, the less flexibility it may become. With less flexibility to adapt and escape the host immunity, the virus may have to rely more on younger naïve population. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Antigenic drift; Evolution; H1N1; Influenza virus; Sequence entropy,amino acid; epitope; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; amino acid sequence; Article; entropy; epidemic; evolutionary rate; genetic variability; Influenza A virus (H1N1); nonhuman; priority journal; seasonal influenza,Article

The cyst expansion deteriorates the renal function and, therefore, therapies targeting cyst enlargement are of clinical interest. Of note, inhibition of vasopressin function using vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) antagonist which decreased cAMP production along with AQP2 production and function can slow cyst growth in ADPKD. This finding supports the role of AQP2 in cyst enlargement. Steviol, a major metabolite of the sweetening compound stevioside, was reported to retard MDCK cyst growth and enlargement by inhibiting CFTR activity. Interestingly, its efficacy was found to be higher than that of CFTRinh-172. Since steviol was also found to produce diuresis in rodent, it is likely that steviol might have an additional effect in retarding cyst progression, such as inhibition of AQP2 expression and function. Here, we investigated the effect of steviol on AQP2 function and on cyst growth using an in vitro cyst model (MDCK and Pkd1−/− cells). We found that steviol could markedly inhibit cyst growth by reducing AQP2 expression in both Pkd1−/− and MDCK cells. Real-time PCR also revealed that steviol decreased AQP2 mRNA expression level as well. Moreover, a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, and the lysosomotropic agent, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to abolish the inhibitory effect of steviol in Pkd1−/− cells. Increased lysosomal enzyme marker (LAMP2) expression following steviol treatment clearly confirmed the involvement of lysosomes in steviol action. In conclusion, our finding showed for the first time that steviol slowed cyst growth, in part, by reducing AQP2 transcription, promoted proteasome, and lysosome-mediated AQP2 degradation. Due to its multiple actions, steviol is a promising compound for further development in the treatment of PKD. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Aquaporin 2; Lysosome; Proteasome; Renal cyst growth; Steviol,aquaporin 2; benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; cyclic AMP; cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; hydroxychloroquine; lysosome associated membrane protein 2; messenger RNA; proteasome; steviol; animal cell; Article; controlled study; diuresis; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; gene expression; in vitro study; kidney cyst; kidney polycystic disease; lysosome; MDCK cell line; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA transcription,Article

Many patients with diabetic retinopathy lose their vision because of the late detection of the disease. Thus, this paper is to propose a novel method of hard exudates segmentation in retinal images in an automatic way. (Methods): The existing methods are based on either supervised or unsupervised learning techniques. In addition, the learned segmentation models may often cause miss-detection and/or fault-detection of hard exudates, due to the lack of rich characteristics, the intra-variations, and the similarity with other components in the retinal image. Thus, in this paper, the supervised learning based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is only used to identify initial seeds with high confidences to be hard exudates. Then, the segmentation is finalized by unsupervised learning based on the iterative graph cut (GC) using clusters of initial seeds. Also, in order to reduce color intra-variations of hard exudates in different retinal images, the color transfer (CT) is applied to normalize their color information, in the pre-processing step. (Results): The experiments and comparisons with the other existing methods are based on the two well-known datasets, e_ophtha EX and DIARETDB1. It can be seen that the proposed method outperforms the other existing methods in the literature, with the sensitivity in the pixel-level of 0.891 for the DIARETDB1 dataset and 0.564 for the e_ophtha EX dataset. The cross datasets validation where the training process is performed on one dataset and the testing process is performed on another dataset is also evaluated in this paper, in order to illustrate the robustness of the proposed method. (Conclusions): This newly proposed method integrates the supervised learning and unsupervised learning based techniques. It achieves the improved performance, when compared with the existing methods in the literature.

A total of 39,050 cultures yielded 1,341 target pathogens. Resistance rates were high; 82% each of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were multidrug resistant. Hospital-acquired isolates were more often resistant than community-acquired isolates; resistance trends over time were heterogeneous. K. pneumoniae isolates from neonates were more likely than those from nonneonates to be resistant to ampicillin-gentamicin and third-generation cephalosporins. In patients with community-acquired gram-negative bacteremia, third-generation cephalosporin resistance was associated with increased mortality rates, increased intensive care unit admissions, and 2.26-fold increased healthcare costs among survivors.

The SCB was pretreated by hydrothermal pretreatment using five different types of solid acid catalysts (SACs): (1) self-synthesis SiO2–OSO3H, (2) SO4 2−/TiO2/Fe3O4/WO3, (3) sulfonated bentonite and commercial SAC, (4) Amberlyst® 15, and (5) Dowex® 50WX8. Fractionation of SCB was conducted in a combination with choline acetate (ChOAc) ionic liquid (IL) at moderate temperature. After enzyme hydrolysis, the highest total reducing sugar (TRS) yield of 78.1% was achieved when pretreated with SiO2–OSO3H. For the black liquor from fractionation, the highest amount of lignin could be precipitated from ChOAc IL through treatment with SO4 2−/TiO2/Fe3O4/WO3. Pyrolysis of dry precipitated lignin was performed at 400 and 500 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, and phenolic-rich oil was produced. Carbon microspheres appeared in the solid phase from the pyrolysis. It was postulated that lignin was first degraded to phenol with an aromatic structure, while other sugar residues (C5 and C6) in the lignin molecule formed ring compounds. These compounds underwent condensation polymerization as a shell-like shape, and carbon rich microspheres were thus formed. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Bio-oil; Carbon microspheres; Hydrothermal; Ionic liquid; Pyrolysis; Solid acid catalyst; Sugarcane bagasse,Bagasse; Biofuels; Catalysts; Condensation reactions; Hydrothermal synthesis; Ionic liquids; Lignin; Polycondensation; Pyrolysis; Silica; Bio oil; Carbon microspheres; Hydrothermal; Solid acid catalysts; Sugar-cane bagasse; Microspheres,Article

An andrographolide analogue, 3A.1 (19-tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-8, 17-epoxy andrographolide) has previously been reported to be potently cytotoxic toward cancer cells by unknown molecular mechanisms. The present study explored the anti-cancer activity of analogue 3A.1 on Wnt/β-catenin signaling in colon cancer cells (HT29 cells) which were more sensitive to the others (HCT116 and SW480 cells). Analogue 3A.1 inhibited viability of HT29 cells with IC50 value of 11.1 ± 1.4 μM at 24 h, which was more potent than that of the parent andrographolide. Analogue 3A.1 also suppressed the proliferation of HT29 cells and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Its apoptotic activity was accompanied with increased expressions of proteins related to DNA damages; PARP-1 and γ-H2AX. In addition, analogue 3A.1 significantly inhibited T-cell factor and lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) promoter activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Accordingly, the expressions of Wnt target genes and β-catenin protein were suppressed. Moreover, analogue 3A.1 increased the activity of GSK-3β kinase, which is a negative regulator responsible for degradation of intracellular β-catenin. This mode of action was further supported by the absence of the effects after treatment with a GSK-3β inhibitor, and over-expression of a mutant β-catenin (S33Y). Our findings reveal, for the first time, an insight into the molecular mechanism of the anti-cancer activity of analogue 3A.1 through the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin/GSK-3β pathway and provide a therapeutic potential of the andrographolide analogue 3A.1 in CRC treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Andrographolide analogue; Anti-cancer; Colorectal cancer; GSK-3β; Wnt/β-catenin,"3a.1 (19 tert butyldiphenylsilyl 8, 17 epoxy andrographolide); andrographolide; antineoplastic agent; beta catenin; cyclin D1; doxorubicin; histone H2AX; matrilysin; Myc protein; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; survivin; T cell factor protein; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; cell viability; colorectal cancer; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA damage; dose response; drug mechanism; gene expression; HCT 116 cell line; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; SW480 cell line; Wnt signaling",Article

CA16 infections are usually mild, while EV71 disease may be fatal due to neurologic complications. As such, the ability to rapidly and specifically recognize EV71 is needed to facilitate proper case management and epidemic control. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to generate antibodies to EV71-virion protein-2 (VP2) by phage display technology for further use in specific detection of EV71. A recombinant peptide sequence of EV71-VP2, carrying a predicted conserved B cell epitope fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (designated GST-EV71-VP2/131-160), was produced. The fusion protein was used as bait in in-solution biopanning to separate protein-bound phages from a murine scFv (MuscFv) phage display library constructed from an immunoglobulin gene repertoire from naïve ICR mice. Three phage-transformed E. coli clones (clones 63, 82, and 83) produced MuscFvs that bound to the GST-EV71-VP2/131-160 peptide. The MuscFv of clone 83 (MuscFv83), which produced the highest ELISA signal to the target antigen, was further tested. MuscFv83 also bound to full-length EV71-VP2 and EV71 particles, but did not bind to GST, full-length EV71-VP1, or the antigenically related CA16. MuscFv83 could be a suitable reagent for rapid antigen-based immunoassay, such as immunochromatography (ICT), for the specific detection and/or diagnosis of EV71 infection as well as epidemic surveillance. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"capsid protein; epitope; hybrid protein; neutralizing antibody; single chain fragment variable antibody; virus antibody; animal; biosynthesis; Enterovirus A; Enterovirus infection; Escherichia coli; genetics; hand foot and mouth disease; human; immunology; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; mouse; peptide library; virology; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Capsid Proteins; Enterovirus A, Human; Enterovirus Infections; Epitopes; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Escherichia coli; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Peptide Library; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Single-Chain Antibodies",Article

The positive predictive values were high in universal and swine- and cattle-specific markers (85–100%), while the positive predictive value of the human-specific assay was 52.2%. The negative predictive values in all assays were relatively high (90.8–100%). A suite of PCR assays in Thailand was established for potential MST use in environmental waters, which supports the worldwide applicability of Bacteroidales gene markers. This study also emphasizes the importance of using a proper sample size in assessing the performance of MST markers in a new geographic region. The successful validation of the Bacteroidales fecal markers for MST with fecal samples in Southeast Asia strongly supports their global use, with an emphasis on significant sample size calculation as a vital approach for evaluating MST markers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Bacteroidales; Microbial source tracking; PCR; Southeast Asia; Tropical watershed,Animals; Assays; Developing countries; Genes; Sampling; Sewage; Statistical tests; Water pollution; Watersheds; Agricultural watersheds; Bacteroidales; Confidence interval; Microbial source tracking; Negative predictive value; Positive predictive values; Southeast Asia; Stratified random sampling; Polymerase chain reaction; article; Bacteroidales; calculation; chin; diagnostic test accuracy study; farm animal; human; human tissue; limit of detection; major clinical study; marker gene; nonhuman; pig; plasmid; predictive value; prevalence; real time polymerase chain reaction; sample size; sewage; Thailand; validation process; watershed; Animalia; Bacteroidales; Bos; Suidae,Article

Evidently, brain insulin signaling contributes to physiological effects, including energy homeostasis, and learning and memory. Arsenic has been shown to impair insulin signaling in adipocytes and myocytes, however, this impairment has not yet been explored in neurons. Here we showed that NaAsO2 caused significant reduction in basal levels of glucose, plasma membrane glucose transporter, GLUT 3 and Akt phosphorylation in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. NaAsO2 significantly decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake, as well as GLUT1 and 3 membrane translocation. Furthermore, the ability of insulin to increase Akt phosphorylation, a well-recognized insulin signaling response, was significantly lessened by NaAsO2 treatment. In addition, the classical tyrosine phosphorylation response of insulin was reduced by NaAsO2, as evidenced by reduction of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1(IRS-1). Moreover, NaAsO2 lowered the ratio of p110, a catalytic subunit to p85, a regulatory subunit of PI3K causing an imbalance between p110 and p85, the conditions reported to contribute to insulin sensitivity. Additionally, increment of IRS-1 interaction with GSK3β, and p85-PI3K were observed in NaAsO2 treated cells. These molecular modulations may be mechanistically attributed to neuronal insulin signaling impairment by arsenic. © 2018",Akt; Arsenic; Insulin; Insulin receptor (IR); Insulin receptor substrate (IRS); PI3K,arsenic; glucose; glucose transporter; glucose transporter 1; glucose transporter 3; glycogen synthase kinase 3; insulin receptor; insulin receptor substrate 1; protein kinase B; Article; cell differentiation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; cytotoxicity test; enzyme phosphorylation; glucose transport; human; human cell; insulin signaling; priority journal; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein transport; quantitative analysis; SH-SY5Y cell line,Article

In this study, we enlarged sample size and developed a technique for identifying brain tissue in aged samples. Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis—for EML2 (COBRA-EML2) technique was established and validated in various organ samples obtained from 108 autopsies. In addition, this technique was also tested for its reliability, minimal DNA concentration detected, and use in aged samples and in samples obtained from specific brain compartments and spinal cord. COBRA-EML2 displayed 100% sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing brain tissue from other tissues, showed high reliability, was capable of detecting minimal DNA concentration (0.015 ng/μl), could be used for identifying brain tissue in aged samples. In summary, COBRA-EML2 is a technique to identify brain tissue. This analysis is useful in criminal cases since it can identify the vital organ tissues from small samples acquired from criminal scenes. The results from this analysis can be counted as a medical and forensic marker supporting criminal investigations, and as one of the evidences in court rulings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",COBRA-EML2; DNA methylation; EML2; Site-specific methylation,bisulfite; DNA; age; Article; autopsy; brain tissue; combined bisulfite restriction analysis EML2; controlled study; diagnostic test; DNA determination; EML2 gene; forensic medicine; gene; genetic procedures; human; human tissue; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity,Article

Methods Data from 87 patients with cervical cancer recruited from a referral hospital in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia, from an earlier study of health-related quality of life were used in this study. The differences among the utility scores derived from the four value sets were determined using the Friedman test. Performance of the psychometric properties of the four value sets versus visual analogue scale (VAS) was assessed. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used to test the agreement among the utility scores. Spearman ρ correlation coefficients were used to assess convergent validity between utility scores and patients’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. With respect to known-group validity, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine the differences in utility according to the stages of cancer. Results There was significant difference among utility scores derived from the four value sets, among which the Malaysian value set yielded higher utility than the other three value sets. Utility obtained from the Malaysian value set had more agreements with VAS than the other value sets versus VAS (intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plot tests results). As for the validity, the four value sets showed equivalent psychometric properties as those that resulted from convergent and known-group validity tests. Conclusions In the absence of an Indonesian value set, the Malaysian value set was more preferable to be used compared with the other value sets. Further studies on the development of an Indonesian value set need to be conducted. © 2017",cervical cancer patients; EQ-5D; Indonesia; utility; value sets comparison,adult; Article; Bland Altman plot; cancer patient; cancer staging; comparative study; controlled study; convergent validity; correlation coefficient; demography; EuroQol five dimensional three level index score; female; Friedman test; human; Indonesia; Kruskal Wallis test; major clinical study; Malaysia; Malaysian; priority journal; psychometry; quality of life; quality of life assessment; scoring system; Singapore; Singaporean; statistical parameters; Thailand; United Kingdom; uterine cervix cancer; value set; visual analog scale,Article

Functional studies using RNA interference have suggested that PmHHAP is involved in hemocyte homeostasis by controlling apoptosis during WSSV infection. In this study, the role of PmHHAP in host–viral interactions was further investigated. Yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that PmHHAP binds to an anti-apoptosis protein, WSSV134. The viral protein WSSV134 is a late protein of WSSV, expressed 24 h post infection (hpi). Gene silencing of WSSV134 in WSSV-infected shrimp resulted in a reduction of the expression level of the viral replication marker genes VP28, wsv477, and ie-1, which suggests that WSSV134 is likely involved in viral propagation. However, co-silencing of PmHHAP and WSSV134 counteracted the effects on WSSV infection, which implies the importance of the host–pathogen interaction between PmHHAP and WSSV134 in WSSV infection. In addition, caspase 3/7 activity was noticeably induced in the PmHHAP and WSSV134 co-silenced shrimp upon WSSV infection. Moreover, PmHHAP and WSSV134 inhibited caspase-induced activation of PmCasp in vitro in a non-competitive manner. Taken together, these results suggest that PmHHAP and WSSV134 play a role in the host–pathogen interaction and work concordantly to control apoptosis in WSSV infection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Apoptosis; Caspase; Hemocyte homeostasis-associated protein; Shrimp immunity; White spot syndrome virus,double stranded RNA; hemocyte homeostasis associated protein; unclassified drug; viral protein; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; blood cell; competitive inhibition; DNA template; enzyme activation; gene knockdown; gene silencing; genetic screening; host pathogen interaction; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; nonhuman; Penaeus monodon; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; promoter region; protein analysis; protein protein interaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA interference; upregulation; virus gene; virus replication; White spot syndrome virus,Article

Eligible were 955 patients with AA, treated first line with Thymoglobulin, between 2001 and 2008 (n = 492), or between 2009 and 2012 (n = 463). The median age of the patients was 21 years (range 1-84). Mortality within 90 days was 5.7% and 2.4%, respectively in the two time periods (P =.007).The actuarial 10-year survival for the entire population was 70%; transplant free survival was 64%. Predictors of survival in multivariate analysis, were severity of the disease, patients age and the interval between diagnosis and treatment. Survival was 87% vs 61% for responders at 6 months versus nonresponders (P <.0001). The 10-year survival of nonresponders at 6 months, undergoing a subsequent transplant (n = 110), was 64%, vs 60% for patient not transplantated (n = 266) (P =.1). The cumulative incidence of response was 37%, 52%, 65% respectively, at 90, 180, and 365 days. In multivariate analysis, negative predictors of response at 6 months, were older age, longer interval diagnosis treatment, and greater severity of the disease. In conclusion, early mortality is low after first line treatment of AA with Thymoglobulin, and has been further reduced after year 2008. Patients age, together with interval diagnosis—treament and severity of the disease, remain strong predictors of response and survival. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,cyclosporine; thymocyte antibody; adult; age; aged; aplastic anemia; Article; Asia; cancer survival; cause of death; child; controlled study; delayed diagnosis; disease severity; Europe; female; human; human cell; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; prediction; preschool child; priority journal; retrospective study; school child; therapy delay; transplant free survival; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult,Article

Our objective was to establish standard outcome measures for postoperative pulmonary complications research. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, Web of Science, SciELO, and the Korean Journal Database. Definitions were extracted from included manuscripts. We then conducted a three-stage Delphi consensus process to select the optimal outcome measures in terms of methodological quality and overall suitability for perioperative trials. Results: From 2358 records, the full texts of 81 manuscripts were retrieved, of which 45 met the inclusion criteria. We identified three main categories of outcome measure specific to perioperative pulmonary outcomes: (i) composite outcome measures of multiple pulmonary outcomes (27 definitions); (ii) pneumonia (12 definitions); and (iii) respiratory failure (six definitions). These were rated by the group according to suitability for routine use. The majority of definitions were given a low score, and many were imprecise, difficult to apply consistently, or both, in large patient populations. A small number of highly rated definitions were identified as appropriate for widespread use. The group then recommended four outcome measures for future use, including one new definition. Conclusions: A large number of postoperative pulmonary outcome measures have been used, but most are poorly defined.

However, its application is limited by short-term effectiveness and requirement of lifelong periodic administration of SSO, especially for chronic diseases like thalassemias. Here, we engineered lentiviral vectors that stably express U7 small nuclear RNA (U7 snRNA) carrying the splice-switching sequence of the SSO that restores correct splicing of βE-globin pre-mRNA and achieves a long-term therapeutic effect. Using a two-step tiling approach, we systematically screened U7 snRNAs carrying splice-switching SSO sequences targeted to the cryptic 5′ splice site created by HbE mutation. We tested this approach and identified the most responsive element for mediating splicing correction in engineered U7 snRNAs in HeLa-βE cell model cell line. Remarkably, the U7 snRNA lentiviral vector (U7 βE4+1) targeted to this region effectively restored the correctly-spliced βE-globin mRNA for at least 5 months. Moreover, the effects of the U7 βE4+1 snRNA lentiviral vector were also evident as upregulation of the correctly-spliced βE-globin mRNA in erythroid progenitor cells from β-thalassemia/HbE patients treated with the vector, which led to improvements of pathologies in erythroid progenitor cells from thalassemia patients. These results suggest that the splicing correction of βE-globin pre-mRNA by the engineered U7 snRNA lentiviral vector provides a promising, long-term treatment for β-thalassemia/HbE. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Gene therapy; HbE; RNA splicing; Thalassemia; U7 snRNA,"hemoglobin E; lentivirus vector; messenger RNA; small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; small nuclear RNA; hemoglobin beta chain; hemoglobin E; RNA precursor; small nuclear RNA; U7 small nuclear RNA; Article; controlled study; erythroid cell; erythroid precursor cell; gene expression; genetic engineering; hemoglobin E-beta thalassemia; human; human cell; mutation; priority journal; protein expression; RNA sequence; RNA splice site; RNA splicing; upregulation; viral gene therapy; beta thalassemia; chemistry; exon; gene therapy; gene vector; genetic engineering; genetics; HeLa cell line; Lentivirus; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; pathology; primary cell culture; procedures; Base Sequence; beta-Globins; beta-Thalassemia; Erythroid Precursor Cells; Exons; Genetic Engineering; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; HeLa Cells; Hemoglobin E; Humans; Lentivirus; Mutation; Primary Cell Culture; RNA Precursors; RNA Splice Sites; RNA Splicing; RNA, Small Nuclear",Article

In this study, a subset of bacterial strains from children was isolated and evaluated for beneficial probiotic traits such as antimicrobial activity, bile and acid tolerance, and pathogenic cell adherence inhibition. The strain with the best antimicrobial activity was selected for further characterization on the basis of morphological, biochemical characteristics and gene sequence. This strain was Gram-positive, oxidase and catalase-negative, and it produced acids by fermenting sugar and starch as carbon sources. Additionally, it could only hydrolyze bile-esculin, but not red blood cells. The 16S rDNA gene sequence revealed that this strain was Enterococcus faecalis. Interestingly, this strain effectively inhibited a variety of pathogens by acid and bacteriocin production and was bile-tolerant, able to survive under acidic condition. In the safety assessments, E. faecalis MTC 1032 could adhere to host epithelial cells and evidently inhibited pathogenic cell adhesion as demonstrated by cell reduction over time of E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. typhimurium ATCC 13311 on Caco-2 cell line.

Aim of the study: With this study we firstly aim to document the practice of cancer treatment and prevention by TTM practitioners and, secondly, to evaluate how such traditional concepts and practices are correlated with biomedical ones. This in turn can form the basis for developing novel strategies for designing pharmacological experiments and longer term strategies to develop TTM practice. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 33 TTM practitioners were performed in five provinces in different regions of Thailand. The following information were recorded; basic information of informants, descriptions of cancer (mareng in Thai), causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Plants used in the treatment and prevention of mareng were also collected. Results: Using an in depth ethnographic approach four representative case studies to assist in a better understanding of the characteristics of mareng, its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are reported here. Five characteristics of mareng – waste accumulation (khong sia), chronic illnesses (krasai), inflammation (kan aksep), bad blood (luead) and lymph (namlueang), and the imbalance of four basic elements (dhātu si) – have been identified. Explanatory models of cancer in TTM were linked with biomedical concepts and relevant pharmacological actions. Traditional uses and available scientific evidence of medicinal plants mentioned in the case studies for the treatment or prevention of mareng are presented and discussed. Conclusion: Here for the first time five main characteristics of cancer based on Thai traditional medical concepts are analysed. Our findings are relevant not only for the planning of clinical studies or pharmacological experiment in the search for novel compounds for cancer treatment and prevention, but also for the integration of Thai traditional medicine in cancer care. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cancer; Integrative medicine; Mareng; Thai traditional medicine; Traditional medicine,herbaceous agent; anthropology; Article; bioaccumulation; cancer diagnosis; cancer prevention; cancer therapy; chronic disease; circulation; clinical evaluation; clinical practice; Dangdeed; Emblica officinalis; ethnopharmacology; Horathaosunak; Huayang; human; inflammation; Kasalong; Khanthongpha yabat; Khanunsampalo; Khaoyennuea; Khaoyentai; Khokhlan; lymph node; Makhampom; malignant neoplasm; medicinal plant; mung bean; Nontaiyak; Oidam; Peeb; Phakdeed; Phakkhaotong; Phakwanban; Phlukhao; Rangchued; semi structured interview; Terminalia bellirica; Thailand; Thaowanpriang; Thuakheaw; traditional medicine; Triphala; Yadokkhao; Yamornoi; Yapakkhwai,Article

Efficient loading of BDP inside the HNT lumen was demonstrated. Qualitative and quantitative characterization of BDP-loaded HNT revealed that BDP was mainly encapsulated inside the central lumen of halloysite and also located in the small pores on the outer surface of HNT. The use of only BDP (up to 4 wt%) or HNT (up to 10 wt%) cannot improve the UL-94 of the PA6 to reach V-0 classification. By combining use of HNT and BDP, the nanocomposites achieved V-0 rating with significant suppression in peak heat release rate and total heat release from cone calorimeter. The negative effect of BDP on strength and rigidity of PA6 composites was obviously minimized by encapsulating some portions of BDP in the nanotube. As a result, the tensile strength and thermal stability of the PA6 retained without loss of stiffness. During burning process, the BDP in the bulk polymer performed its function in the early period of the process, whereas the BDP inside the nanotube possessed a prolonged release for flame retardation at the later stage of combustion. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,Flame retardants; Kaolinite; Mechanical properties; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Tensile strength; Thermodynamic stability; Yarn; Cone calorimeter; Flame retardancy; Flame retardation; Halloysite nanotubes; Peak heat release rates; Prolonged release; Quantitative characterization; Total heat release; Combustion,Article

After previously establishing that lentiviral transfer of a marked β-globin (βA-T87Q) gene could substitute for long-term red-cell transfusions in a patien with β-thalassemia, we wanted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of such gene therapy in patients with transfusiondependent β-thalassemia. METHODS: In two phase 1-2 studies, we obtained mobilized autologos CD34+ cells from 22 patients (12 to 35 years of age) with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and transduced the cells ex vivo with LentiGlobin BB305 vector, which encodes adult hemoglobin (HbA) with a T87Q amino acid substitution (HbAT87Q). The cells were then reinfused after the patients had undergone myeloablative busulfan conditioning. We subsequently monitored adverse events, vector integration, and levels of replicatin-competent lentivirus. Efficacy assessments included levels of total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q, transfusion requirements, and average vector copy number. RESULTS: At a median of 26 months (range, 15 to 42) after infusion of the gene-modified cells, all but 1 of the 13 patients who had a non-β0/β0 genotype had stopped receiving red-cell transfusions; the levels of HbAT87Q ranged from 3.4 to 10.0 g per deciliter, and the levels of total hemoglobin ranged from 8.2 to 13.7 g per deciliter. Correction of biologic markers of dyserythropoiesis was achieved in evaluated patients with hemoglobin levels near normal ranges. In 9 patients with a β0/β genotype or two copies of the IVS1-110 mutation, the median annualized transfusion volume was decreased by 73%, and red-cell transfusions were discontinued in 3 patients. Treatment-related adverse events were typical of those associated with autologous stem-cell transplantation. No clonal dominance related to vector integration was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Gene therapy with autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BB305 vector reduced or eliminated the need for long-term red-cell transfusions in 22 patients with severe β-thalassemia witout serious adverse events related to the drug product.

The rhodol levulinate probe (RL) demonstrated high selectivity and sensitivity toward hydrazine among other molecules. The chromogenic response of RL solution to hydrazine from colorless to pink could be readily observed by the naked eye, while strong fluorescence emission could be monitored upon excitation at 525 nm. The detection process occurred via a ring-opening process of the spirolactone initiated by hydrazinolysis, triggering the fluorescence emission with a 53-fold enhancement. The probe rapidly reacted with hydrazine in aqueous medium with the detection limit of 26 nM (0.83 ppb), lower than the threshold limit value (TLV) of 10 ppb suggested by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, RL-impregnated paper strips could detect hydrazine vapor. For biological applicability of RL, its membrane-permeable property led to bioimaging of hydrazine in live HepG2 cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bioimaging; Fluorescent detection; Hydrazine-selective chemosensor; Levulinate; Rhodol,Environmental Protection Agency; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Negative ions; Nitrogen compounds; Physiology; Probes; Bio-imaging; Chemosensor; Fluorescent detection; Levulinate; Rhodol; Hydrazine,Article

However, the solid state reaction of effective catalyst and starch molecules requires specific interaction between active sites in catalyst and α,1-4 glycosidic bonds in starch. Therefore, in this study catalyst mixed-milling was conducted prior to thermal hydrolysis to enhance glucose production efficiency. The results showed that catalyst mixed-milling process (24 h) followed by thermo-hydrolysis at 140 °C for 6 h using HA-L-SO3H gave highest starch conversion of 93.72% corresponding to 37.45% glucose yield and 83% selectivity. From the kinetic study, the rate constant of cassava mash-to-oligomers conversion (k1) using catalyst mixed-milling was 1.77 times higher than ball-milling without adding catalyst. This indicated that mixed-milling solid state reaction with effective catalyst significantly provided complete cassava mash conversion and enhanced selectivity as well as rate of starch depolymerization reaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Ball-milling; Carbonaceous solid acid catalyst; Cassava mash; Mixed-milling; Starch thermo-hydrolysis,Ball milling; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Glucose; Hydrolysis; Milling (machining); Plants (botany); Rate constants; Solid state reactions; Starch; Cassava mashes; Glucose production; Glycosidic bond; Solid acid catalysts; Specific interaction; Starch depolymerization; Starch molecules; Thermal hydrolysis; Catalyst activity; catalyst; chemical bonding; chemical reaction; crop residue; energy efficiency; glucose; hydrolysis; milling; reaction kinetics; solid; starch; Manihot esculenta,Article

The physicochemical properties of Mag-H were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), texture analyzer, swelling test, and in vitro drug release behavior using methylene blue (MB) as a model drug. The FTIR spectra showed that glutaraldehyde crosslinked with gelatin. To improve the thermal and mechanical properties of gelatin hydrogel (Gel-H), the BC and magnetic nanoparticles were incorporated into the gelatin network. Due to the superparamagnetism of magnetic nanoparticles, Mag-H possessed a powerful magnetic property for achieving a magnetic targeting. Mag-H had a maximum swelling ratio of 1085 ± 12% in phosphate buffer saline (pH 1.2) at 37 °C, meanwhile its maximum drug release of 80.77 ± 0.33% was observed at the same condition with an external magnetic field application.

Clinically significant Rh blood group system antigens, including D, C, E, c, and e, can be simultaneously identified via solid phase immobilization assay, which offers significant time savings and assay simplification. Red blood cells (RBCs) flowed through the micro-channel, where a suitable condition for Rh blood group detection was an RBC dilution of 1:10 with a stop-flow condition. Stop flow showed an improvement in specific binding compared to continuous flow. Rh antigens required a longer incubation time to react with the immobilized antibody than A and B antigens due to the difference in antigen type and their location on the RBC. The interaction between the immobilized antibodies and their specific antigenic counterpart on the RBC showed a significant difference in RBC removal behavior using shear flow, measured from the decay of the SPR signal. The strength of the interaction between the immobilized antibody and RBC antigen was determined from the minimum wall shear stress required to start the decay process in the SPR signal. For a given range of immobilized antibody surface densities, the Rh antigen possesses a stronger interaction than A, B, and AB antigens. Identification of 82 samples of ABO and Rh blood groups using SPRi showed good agreement with the standard micro-column agglutination technique. A wider coverage of antigenic recognition for RBC when using the solid phase immobilization assay was demonstrated for the RBC with the antigenic site located on the transmembrane protein of the clinically significant Rh antigen. Given the level of accuracy and precision, the technique showed potential for the detection of the Rh minor blood group system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Blood; Blood grouping; Microarray; Rh blood group; SPR imaging,Antibodies; Antigen-antibody reactions; Antigens; Bioassay; Blood; Microarrays; Plasmons; Rhodium; Shear flow; Shear stress; Accuracy and precision; Blood group; Immobilized antibodies; SPR imaging; Suitable conditions; Surface plasmon resonance imaging; Trans-membrane proteins; Wall shear stress; Surface plasmon resonance; blood group A antigen; blood group B antigen; blood group E antigen; membrane protein; rhesus AB antigen; rhesus antigen; rhesus C antibody; rhesus C antigen; rhesus D antibody; rhesus D antigen; rhesus E antibody; unclassified drug; agglutination test; antigen detection; antigen recognition; Article; blood group rhesus system; blood sampling; cell adhesion; concentration (parameters); controlled study; erythrocyte; hematocrit; immobilization; incubation time; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; shear stress; surface plasmon resonance,Article

The objectives of this study are to investigate crop-residue management and estimate the amount of pollutant emissions from burning crop residues for each land-use pattern (grain maize, seed maize and integrated farming), and to estimate the chemical compositions of PM2.5 emissions from agricultural burning in Mae Chaem basin, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. The purposive sampling method was used for sample selection. A door-to-door questionnaire survey was used to obtain responses from 149 respondents. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the open burning of crop residues were estimated, using specific emission factors obtained from several literature reviews and from the field by the questionnaire survey. Results revealed that the majority of farmers burned maize residues during April and May and mostly in the afternoon. These burning behaviors are in line with the supportive weather conditions that reflect high values of temperature and wind speed, and less rainfall and relative humidity result in maize residues being burned easily and quickly. The integrated farming system generated the lowest GHG emissions and amount of chemical composition of PM2.5 emissions, followed by the grain maize and seed maize patterns, respectively. This study strongly supports the implementation of the integrated farming system in Mae Chaem basin. Proactive and reactive measures should be taken in a well-organized and systematic fashion and should engage all related parties.

Scholars have also shown that ‘Third World’ tourism fuelled by media fantasies of the Other represents neo-colonization in the twenty-first century. However, considering all its intentions/claims of impartiality, tourism research has generally travelled in only one direction (from the West to the East). In this study, conducted in Goa and Puducherry, focusing on the social contexts in which people are viewed and photographed, we ask–what do the ‘Third World’ people think of Westerners gazing at them, and their surroundings? How do Western tourists react when photographed by domestic tourists? What are the power relations within which the photographer and the photographed are located? We recognize that no simplistic analyses are possible in the postcolonial context.

In this review we summarize the core roles of snails in the life cycles of the parasites they host, their clinical manifestations and disease distributions, as well as snail control methods. Main body: Snails have four roles in the life cycles of the parasites they host: as an intermediate host infected by the first-stage larvae, as the only intermediate host infected by miracidia, as the first intermediate host that ingests the parasite eggs are ingested, and as the first intermediate host penetrated by miracidia with or without the second intermediate host being an aquatic animal. Snail-borne parasitic diseases target many organs, such as the lungs, liver, biliary tract, intestines, brain and kidneys, leading to overactive immune responses, cancers, organ failure, infertility and even death. Developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America have the highest incidences of these diseases, while some endemic parasites have developed into worldwide epidemics through the global spread of snails. Physical, chemical and biological methods have been introduced to control the host snail populations to prevent disease. Conclusions: In this review, we summarize the roles of snails in the life cycles of the parasites they host, the worldwide distribution of parasite-transmitting snails, the epidemiology and pathogenesis of snail-transmitted parasitic diseases, and the existing snail control measures, which will contribute to further understanding the snail-parasite relationship and new strategies for controlling snail-borne parasitic diseases. © 2018 The Author(s).",Epidemiology; Pathogenesis; Snail control; Snail-borne parasitic diseases,angiostrongyliasis; clonorchiasis; fascioliasis; fasciolopsiasis; geographic information system; immune response; infertility; life cycle assessment; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; paragonimiasis; parasite control; parasite transmission; parasitosis; pathogenesis; priority journal; remote sensing; Review; schistosomiasis,Review

(C. comosa) or Wan chak motluk Zingiberaceae family, is widely used in Thai traditional medicine for treatment of gynecological problems as well as relief of postmenopausal symptoms. Since C. comosa contains phytoestrogen and causes lipid lowering effect by an unknown mechanism, we investigated its effect on adiposity and lipid metabolism in estrogen-deprived rats. Materials and methods Adult female rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and received daily doses of either a phytoestrogen from C. comosa [(3R)–1,7-diphenyl-(4E,6E)–4,6-heptadien-3-ol; DPHD], C. comosa extract, or estrogen (17β-estradiol; E2) for 12 weeks. Adipose tissue mass, serum levels of lipids and adipokines were determined. In addition, genes and proteins involved in lipid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation in visceral adipose tissue were analyzed. Results Ovariectomy for 12 weeks elevated level of serum lipids and increased visceral fat mass and adipocyte size. These alterations were accompanied with the up-regulation of lipogenic mRNA and protein expressions including LXR-α SREBP1c and their downstream targets. OVX rats showed decrease in proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation including AMPK-α and PPAR-α in adipose tissue, as well as alteration of adipokines; leptin and adiponectin. Treatments with E2, DPHD or C. comosa extract in OVX rats prevented an increase in adiposity, down-regulated lipogenic genes and proteins with marked increases in the protein levels of AMPK-α and PPAR-α. These findings indicated that their lipid lowering effects were mediated via the suppression of lipid synthesis in concert with an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Conclusions C. comosa exerts a lipid lowering effect in the estrogen deficient rats through the modulations of lipid synthesis and AMPK-α activity in adipose tissues, supporting the use of this plant for health promotion in the post-menopausal women. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Anti-adiposity; Curcuma comosa; Diarylheptanoid; Ovariectomy; Phytoestrogen,acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; acyl coenzyme A desaturase 1; adiponectin; Curcuma comosa extract; estrogen; fatty acid synthase; glucose; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin; leptin; lipid; liver X receptor alpha; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; plant extract; resistin; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; cell size; cholesterol blood level; comparative study; controlled study; Curcuma; Curcuma comosa; cytokine release; down regulation; dyslipidemia; fatty acid oxidation; female; glucose blood level; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intraperitoneal fat; lipid metabolism; nonhuman; obesity; ovariectomy; protein expression; rat; triacylglycerol blood level; upregulation; uterus weight,Article

Methods: Collaborative retrospective analysis of ARD. Outcome measures were number of surgical interventions, final retinal reattachment, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at last follow-up. Results: Seventeen eyes of 16 patients (12 males; mean age =37.8 years) had the following complications at presentation: macula off (14), total (7) or inferior detachment (5), proliferative vitreoretinopathy (5), detectable break (16), lattice (5), horseshoe tears (9), and giant tear or dialysis (4). Mean number of interventions was 1.8 (range =1–5) and included cryopexy (15) with scleral buckle (11), and/or vitrectomy (8). Mean initial BCVA was counting finger (CF) 1 m and at last follow-up (mean 77 months) CF4m with mean improvement of 4.5 lines (early treatment diabetic retinopathy study) (P=0.05). Intraoperative choroidal hemorrhage occurred in three eyes. The retina was finally attached in 14 eyes, with residual inferior detachment in three eyes with silicone oil in situ. Silicone oil was kept in six of seven eyes because of residual inferior detachment (3) and removal of silicone oil, which led to redetachment (1) or fear of redetachment (2). Conclusion: Repair of ARD may require several interventions, with the need to keep silicone oil in several cases due to nystagmus and reduced melanin pigment. © 2018 Mansour et al.",Cryopexy; Foveal hypoplasia; Nystagmus; Retinal detachment; Scleral buckle; Silicone oil; Vitrectomy,silicone oil; adolescent; adult; albinism; Article; best corrected visual acuity; blunt trauma; child; choroid hemorrhage; clinical article; clinical outcome; controlled study; cryosurgery; dialysis; female; follow up; human; macular edema; male; middle aged; peroperative complication; retina detachment; retina tear; retinopexy; retrospective study; vitrectomy; vitreoretinopathy,Article

In Thailand, the National Antidote Project (NAP) has operated since November 2010 to manage the national antidote stockpile, educate the healthcare providers on appropriate antidote use, and evaluate antidote usage. Objective: To evaluate the effect of NAP implementation on mortality rate and antidote use in cyanide poisoning cases arising from ingestion of cyanide or cyanogenic glycoside. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort of poisoning cases involving cyanide or cyanogenic glycoside ingestion reported to Ramathibodi Poison Center from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2015. Mortality rate, antidote use, and appropriateness of antidote use (defined as correct indication, proper dosing regimen, and administration within 90 min) before and after NAP implementation were compared. Association between parameters and fatal outcomes was analyzed. Results: A total of 343 cases involving cyanide or cyanogenic glycoside ingestion were reported to Ramathibodi Poison Center. There were 213 cases (62.1%) during NAP (Project group) and 130 cases (37.9%) pre-NAP implementation (Before group). Implementation of NAP led to increased antidote use (39.9% in Project group versus 24.6% in Before group) and a higher rate of appropriate antidote use (74.1% in Project group versus 50.0% in Before group). All 30 deaths were presented with initial severe symptoms. Cyanide chemical source and self-harm intent were associated with death (OR: 12.919, 95% CI: 4.863–39.761 and OR: 10.747, 95% CI: 3.884–28.514, respectively). No difference in overall mortality rate (13 [10.0%] deaths before versus 17 [8.0%] deaths after NAP) was found. In subgroup analysis of 80 cases with initial severe symptoms, NAP and appropriate antidote use reduced mortality (OR: 0.327, 95% CI: 0.106–0.997 and OR: 0.024, 95% CI: 0.004–0.122, respectively). In the multivariate analysis of the cases with initial severe symptoms, presence of the NAP and appropriate antidote use independently reduced the risk of death (OR: 0.122, 95% CI: 0.023–0.633 and OR: 0.034, 95% CI: 0.007–0.167, respectively), adjusted for intent of exposure, cyanide source, age, and sex. Conclusions: After NAP implementation, both antidote use and appropriate antidote use increased. In cases presenting with severe symptoms, presence of the NAP and appropriate antidote use independently reduced the risk of mortality. © 2017 The Author(s).

Methods We undertook a post hoc pooled analysis of febrile episodes that occurred during the active surveillance phase (the 25 months after the first study injection) of 2 pivotal phase III, placebo-controlled CYD-TDV efficacy studies that involved ≥31000 children aged 2-16 years across 10 countries in Asia and Latin America. Virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) episode was defined with a positive test for dengue nonstructural protein 1 antigen or dengue polymerase chain reaction. Probable dengue episode was serologically defined as (1) IgM-positive acute- or convalescent-phase sample, or (2) IgG-positive acute-phase sample and ≥4-fold IgG increase between acute- and convalescent-phase samples. Results There were 1284 VCD episodes (575 and 709 in the CYD-TDV and placebo groups, respectively) and 17673 other febrile episodes (11668 and 6005, respectively). Compared with VCD, the sensitivity and specificity of probable dengue definition were 93.1% and 77.2%, respectively. Overall positive and negative predictive values were 22.9% and 99.5%, respectively, reflecting the much lower probability of correctly confirming probable dengue in a population including a vaccinated cohort. Vaccination-induced bias toward false-positive diagnosis was more pronounced among individuals seronegative at baseline. Conclusions Caution will be required when interpreting IgM and IgG data obtained during routine surveillance in those vaccinated with CYD-TDV. There is an urgent need for new practical, dengue-specific diagnostic algorithms now that CYD-TDV is approved in a number of dengue-endemic countries. © 2017 The Author(s).

Methods: Ten warfarin dosing algorithms derived from different population including Caucasian, East Asian, South-East Asian, and mixed races were selected and tested with clinical and genetic data of Thai patients. Comparative performances of these algorithms were tested using mean dose error (MDE) between actual warfarin maintenance dose (AWMD) and predicted dose generated by each dosing algorithm, and percentage of ideal dose prediction (IDP). Sensitivity analysis for predictive accuracy was also conducted by stratifying patients into low (AWMD ≤21 mg/wk), intermediate (AWMD >21 to <49 mg/wk), and high maintenance dose (AWMD ≥49 mg/wk) groups. Results: Data of 165 patients were included for the analyses. Mean actual warfarin dose of the study population was 25.03 ± 10.53 mg/wk. Large variability of MDE, ranging from −12.11 to 11.24 mg/wk, among algorithms was observed. International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, Gage et al, and Ohno et al algorithms had comparable performances to Sangviroon et al algorithm, as observed by MDE of <1 mg/wk with percentage of IDP ≥40%. Further sensitivity analyses among patients requiring low and intermediate maintenance doses confirmed such findings with IDP percentage ranging from 37.8% to 59.2%. Among high-dose group, only Ohno et al and Sarapakdi et al algorithms had acceptable performance. Conclusions: Warfarin PGx-guided dosing algorithms derived from large, mixed population performed comparably to Sangviroon et al algorithm.

It causes a spectrum of illness that could be due to qualitative and/or quantitative difference(s) of the natural killer (NK) cell responses during acute DENV infection. This view prompted us to perform a detailed phenotypic comparative characterization of NK cell subsets from DENV-infected patients with dengue fever (DF), patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and healthy controls. The activation/differentiation molecules, CD69 and CD57 and a variety of tissue homing molecules were analysed on the CD56hi CD16− and CD56lo CD16+ NK cells. Although there was no increase in the frequency of the total NK cells during DENV infection compared with the healthy individuals, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the CD56hi CD16− subset and the frequency of CD69 expression by both NK cell subsets during the febrile phase of infection. We also found an increase in the frequencies of cells expressing CD69 and CD57 in the CD56lo CD16+ subset compared with those in the CD56hi CD16− subset. Moreover, although the CD56lo CD16+ subset contained a high frequency of cells expressing skin-homing markers, the CD56hi CD16− subset contained a high frequency of cells expressing bone marrow and lymph node trafficking markers. Interestingly, no differences of these NK cell subsets were noted in samples from patients with DF versus those with DHF. These findings suggest that activation and differentiation and the patterns of tissue homing molecules of the two major NK cell subsets are different and that these might play a critical role in the immune response against acute DENV infection. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",cell trafficking; dengue infection; innate immunity; natural killer cells,beta1 integrin; beta7 integrin; CD103 antigen; CD56 antigen; CD57 antigen; CD69 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR2; chemokine receptor CCR5; chemokine receptor CCR7; chemokine receptor CCR9; chemokine receptor CXCR3; chemokine receptor CXCR4; interleukin 2 receptor beta; interleukin 2 receptor gamma; L selectin; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9; adolescent; adult; Article; bone marrow; child; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; dengue; dengue hemorrhagic fever; disease severity; female; flow cytometry; human; human cell; lymph node; lymphocyte activation; lymphocyte differentiation; male; natural killer cell; priority journal; skin,Article

This study aimed to assess the frequencies of erroneous positioning during three periods: before retraining of the technologists (BR), after retraining (AR), and at the current timepoint 8 years after retraining (C). The BMD images of the first 150 consecutive patients who underwent DXA of the lumbar spine and hip during each of the three periods were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were excluded if they had severe scoliosis, rendering proper positioning impossible. Each BMD image was assessed by an International Society of Clinical Densitometry certified clinical densitometrist who was blinded to the date of the initial examination. For the lumbar spine in the BR group, the criteria frequently not met were inclusion of both iliac crests (33.8%), straightness (30.3%), and midline positioning (20.4%); the respective frequencies were significantly reduced to 0.8%−5.6%, 2.1%−3.0%, and 0%−2.8% in the AR and C groups (p < 0.05). For the hip in the BR group, the criteria frequently not met were straightness (52.8%) and internal rotation (21.8%); the respective frequencies were significantly reduced to 0%−4.2% and 8.3%−8.4% in the AR and C groups (p < 0.05). Overall improper positioning in the BR group was 49.3% and 57.3% at the lumbar spine and the hip, respectively; the respective frequencies were reduced to 9.3% and 12.7% in the AR group, and to 2.7% and 7.3% in the C group.

Various vegetable oils were screened and the results showed that coconut oil provided the highest curcuminoid solubility, suitable PIT and the largest NE region in the ternary phase diagram for the formation of NE (droplets size 20–100 nm and polydispersity below 0.2). Curcuminoid-loaded NE comprising 8.3 wt% coconut oil with different curcuminoid and RH40 concentrations were prepared. The results revealed that at the RH40 concentration of ≤10 wt%, an increase in curcuminoid concentration resulted in the migration of curcuminoids towards the oil phase, affirmed by the observation of increases in droplet size. Contrarily, no significant changes (p >.05) in droplet size with increased curcuminoid concentration were observed with the NE of RH40 > 10 wt%, related to the migration of curcuminoid molecules from oil droplets into microemulsion droplets in the aqueous phase. All formulations were physically stable for at least two months. However, the degradation of curcuminoids increased with increased temperature and surfactant concentration.

Nevertheless, the diagnostic performance and the appropriate cutoff point of the ESAS for the assessment of depression in these patients have varied in the studies. Purpose: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and the optimal cutoff point for the ESAS for the assessment of depression in patients with cancer. Data Sources: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane library databases from inception to September 18, 2016. Study Selection: Paired reviewers independently screened abstracts and full-text articles for all cross-sectional studies published in English and compared these with the ESAS in the depression (ESAS-D) subscale with reference to standard tests for the assessment of depression. Data Extraction: Two reviewers serially abstracted the data and independently assessed the risk of bias by using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2. Data Synthesis: A total of 6 studies were eligible for review. Our meta-analysis showed the optimal cutoff point of the ESAS-D ≥ 4, with pooled sensitivity and specificity at 53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38%-67%) and 90% (95% CI: 82%-94%), respectively. The positive likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio of the ESAS-D ≥ 4 were 5.2 (95% CI: 3.1-8.6) and 10 (95% CI: 5-19). There was a high degree of heterogeneity between the studies (P value &lt;.001, I2 = 96%). Conclusion: We suggest that an ESAS-D ≥ 4 could be used to detect possible cases of depression in patients with cancer. Registration: Our study protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews on October 4, 2016, and was last updated on January 11, 2017 (registration number CRD42016048288). © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",cancer patients; depression; ESAS; sensitivity; systematic review,adult; article; cancer patient; Cinahl; Cochrane Library; cross-sectional study; data extraction; data synthesis; depression assessment; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; male; Medline; meta analysis; quality control; registration; risk assessment; Scopus; sensitivity and specificity; statistical significance; symptom assessment; systematic review,Article

The PpelOT/VP-like mRNA was 626 bp long and it encoded the preprohormones containing 158 amino acids. This preprohormone consisted of a signal peptide, an active nonapeptide (CFITNCPPG) followed by the dibasic cleavage site (GKR), and the neurophysin domain. Sequence alignment of the PpelOT/VP-like peptide with those of other animals revealed strong molecular conservation. Phylogenetic analysis of encoded proteins revealed that the PpelOT/VP-like peptide was clustered within the group of crustacean OT/VP-like peptide. Analysis by RT-PCR revealed the expression of mRNA transcripts in the eyestalk, brain, ventral nerve cord (VNC), ovary, intestine and gill. The in situ hybridization demonstrated the cellular localizations of the transcripts in the central nervous system (CNS) and ovary tissues. In the eyestalk, the mRNA expression was observed in the neuronal clusters 1–5 but not in the sinus gland complex. In the brain and the VNC, the transcripts were detected in all neuronal clusters but not in the glial cell. In the ovary, the transcripts were found in all stages of oocytes (Oc1, Oc2, Oc3, and Oc4). In addition, synthetic PpelOT/VP-like peptide could inhibit steroid release from the ovary. The knowledge gained from this study will provide more understanding on neuro-endocrinological controls in this crab species. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Molecular cloning; Oxytocin/vasopressin-like peptide; Portunus pelagicus; Steroid release,complementary DNA; messenger RNA; methionine; neurophysin; nonapeptide; oxytocin; signal peptide; transcriptome; vasopressin; 5' untranslated region; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; female; in situ hybridization; maximum likelihood method; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; ovary; ovary tissue; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; Portunus pelagicus; steroid release; ventral root,Article

Does the uneven distribution mean that not everyone benefits from new technologies to the same extent, or do some people experience an absolute disadvantage during this process? I explore this question through the case study of curative healthcare access in the context of rapid mobile phone uptake in rural India, contributing thus to an important yet surprisingly under-researched aspect of the social implications of (mobile) technology diffusion. Inspired by a previous analysis of cross-sectional data from rural India, I hypothesise that health systems increasingly adapt to mobile phone users where phones have diffused widely. This adaptation will leave poor non-adopters worse off than before and increases healthcare inequities. I use a panel of 12,003 rural households with an illness in 2005 and 2012 from the Indian Human Development Survey to test this hypothesis. Based on village-cluster robust fixed-effects linear probability models, I find that (a) mobile phone diffusion is significantly and negatively linked to various forms of rural healthcare access, suggesting that health systems increasingly adapt to phone use and discriminate against non-users; that (b) poor rural households without mobile phones experience more adverse effects compared to more affluent households, which indicates a struggle and competition for healthcare access among marginalised groups; and that (c) no effects emerge for access to public doctors, which implies that some healthcare providers are less responsive to mobile phone use than others. Overall, my findings indicate that the rural Indian healthcare system gradually adapts to increasing mobile phone use at the expense of non-users. I conclude that rapid mobile phone diffusion creates an opportunity to improve people's access to healthcare in rural India, but it also creates new forms of marginalisation among poor rural households. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Asia; Digital inclusion; Healthcare; Household panel data; India; Mobile phones,health care; marginalization; mobile phone; panel data; rural area; technology diffusion; India,Article

Three groups of 10 rats were dermally exposed to three different doses (high, middle and low) for 28 consecutive days. The rats showed significant changes in body, liver, kidneys and adrenals weights. Significant changes were observed in various biological parameters including hematotoxicity (increased leukocyte and platelet counts, percent neutrophil, decreased RBC count, percent lymphocyte and eosinophil), hepatotoxicity (increased serum AST, decreased serum ALP, cholesterol, triglyceride, serum protein and albumin), and immunotoxicity (decrease in numbers of NK cells, decrease splenic proliferative response to LPS, and increase in serum IgG).

There are currently no anti-DENV drugs available, and there has been an intensive search for effective anti-DENV agents that can inhibit all four DENV serotypes. In this study, we tested whether vivo-morpholino oligomers (vivo-MOs), whose effect on DENV infection has not previously been studied, can inhibit DENV infection. Vivo-MOs were designed to target the top of 3’ stem-loop (3’ SL) in the 3’ UTR of the DENV genome and tested for inhibition of DENV infection in monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cells and human lung epithelial carcinoma (A549) cells. The results showed that vivo-MOs could bind to a DENV RNA sequence and markedly reduce DENV-RNA, protein, and virus production in infected Vero and A549 cells. Vivo-MOs at a concentration of 4 µM could inhibit DENV production by more than 104-fold when compared to that of an untreated control. In addition, vivo-MOs also inhibited DENV production in U937 cells and primary human monocytes. Therefore, vivo-MOs targeting to the 3’ SL in the 3’ UTR of DENV genomes are effective and have the potential to be developed as anti-DENV agents. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"antivirus agent; morpholino oligonucleotide; A-549 cell line; animal; base pairing; chemistry; Chlorocebus aethiops; conformation; Dengue virus; drug effects; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; inverted repeat; metabolism; monocyte; primary cell culture; U-937 cell line; Vero cell line; virology; virus genome; virus replication; A549 Cells; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Base Pairing; Cercopithecus aethiops; Dengue Virus; Genome, Viral; Humans; Inverted Repeat Sequences; Monocytes; Morpholinos; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Primary Cell Culture; U937 Cells; Vero Cells; Virus Replication",Article

However, surprisingly little has been exchanged to date, and both realms of inquiry and practice have progressed mostly independent of each other. This paper builds on a session held at the 7th World Fisheries Congress in Busan, South Korea, in May 2016, which explored crossover lessons between marine and freshwater realms, and included case studies of four MPAs and five FPAs (or clusters of FPAs) from nine countries. This review uses the case studies to explore similarities, differences, and transferrable lessons between MPAs and FPAs under five themes: (1) ecological system; (2) establishment approaches; (3) effectiveness monitoring; (4) sustaining APAs; and (5) challenges and external threats. Ecological differences between marine and freshwater environments may necessitate different approaches for collecting species and habitat data to inform APA design, establishment and monitoring, but once collected, similar spatial ecological tools can be applied in both realms. In contrast, many similarities exist in the human dimension of both MPA and FPA establishment and management, highlighting clear opportunities for exchanging lessons related to stakeholder engagement and support, and for using similar socio-economic and governance assessment methods to address data gaps in both realms. Regions that implement MPAs and FPAs could work together to address shared challenges, such as developing mechanisms for diversified and sustained funding, and employing integrated coastal/watershed management to address system-level threats. Collaboration across realms could facilitate conservation of diadromous species in both marine and freshwater habitats. Continued exchange and increased collaboration would benefit both realms, and may be facilitated by defining shared terminology, holding cross-disciplinary conferences or sessions, publishing inclusive papers, and proposing joint projects.

The principal aims of treatment are typically to prevent infection while allowing the wound to heal. This study therefore sought to prepare the hydrogel pads based on silver nanoparticles. To be effective as a wound dressing, the gel fraction, mechanical properties, and swelling capacity of the proposed material must be suitable, and it was found that PVP/alginate/chitosan in the ratio of 10:1.2:1.8 showed the required properties. Furthermore, the silver nanoparticles-based hydrogel was also found to offer antibacterial properties and an absence of cytotoxicity when tested towards human keratinocytes (HaCaT), L929 mouse fibroblasts, and human dermal fibroblasts adult (HDFa). The proposed material was then compared with commercially available dressings (ACTICOAT™ Algivon®, and Suprasorb® A + Ag) with findings showing the superiority of the proposed hydrogel in terms of reduced cost, non-cytotoxicity, and swelling, while the ability to reduce bacteria was shown to be equal to that of the commercial alternatives. Therefore, it can be concluded that silver nanoparticle-based hydrogel offers considerable potential to relieve pressure ulcers through its application as a wound dressing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Alginate; Chitosan; Hydrogel; Pressure ulcer; Silver nanoparticles; Wound dressing,alginic acid; chitosan; povidone; silver nanoparticle; Acinetobacter baumannii; adult; animal cell; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterium colony; cell viability; colony forming unit; controlled study; cytotoxicity; decubitus; disk diffusion; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; HaCat cell line; human; human cell; hydrogel; L cell line; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; mouse; nonhuman; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; skin fibroblast; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis; vancomycin resistant Enterococcus,Article

Background: SSI is common in appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. DPC is preferentially used over PC, but its efficacy is still controversial. Methods: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted in 6 hospitals in Thailand, enrolling patients with gangrenous and ruptured appendicitis. Patients were randomized to PC (ie, immediately wound closure) or DPC (ie, wound closure at postoperative days 3-5). Superficial SSI was defined by the Center for Disease Control criteria. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, length of stay, recovery time, quality of life, and cost of treatment. Results: In all, 303 and 304 patients were randomized to PC and DPC groups, and 5 and 4 patients were lost to follow-up, respectively, leaving 300 and 298 patients in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The superficial SSI rate was lower in the PC than DPC groups [ie, 7.3% (95% confidence interval 4.4, 10.3) vs 10% (95% CI 6.6, 13.3)] with a risk difference (RD) of -2.7% (-7.1%, 1.9%), but this RD was not significant. Postoperative pain, length of stay, recovery times, and quality of life were nonsignificantly different with corresponding RDs of 0.3 (-2.5, 3.0), -0.1 (-0.5, 0.3), -0.2 (-0.8, 0.4), and 0.02 (-0.01, 0.04), respectively. However, costs for PC were 2083 (1410, 2756) Baht cheaper than DPC (∼$60 USD). Conclusions: Superficial SSI rates for the PC group were slightly lower than DPC group, but this did not reach statistical significance. Costs were significantly lower for the PC group. © 2017 The Author(s).

Low- and middle-income countries face difficulties implementing feasible strategies to fulfill this ambitious goal. To contribute to the revitalization of Thailand’s marine ecosystems, we investigated the level of tobacco product waste (TPW) on Thailand’s public beaches. We conducted a cross-sectional observational survey at two popular public beaches. Research staff collected cigarette butts over two eight-hour days walking over a one-kilometer stretch of beach. We also compiled and analyzed data on butts collected from sieved sand at 11 popular beaches throughout Thailand’s coast, with 10 samples of sieved sand collected per beach. Our survey at two beaches yielded 3067 butts in lounge areas, resulting in a mean butt density of 0.44/m2. At the 11 beaches, sieved sand samples yielded butt densities ranging from 0.25 to 13.3/m2, with a mean butt density of 2.26/m2 (SD = 3.78). These densities show that TPW has become a serious problem along Thailand’s coastline. Our findings are comparable with those in other countries. We report on government and civil society initiatives in Thailand that are beginning to address marine TPW. The solution will only happen when responsible parties, especially and primarily tobacco companies, undertake actions to eliminate TPW. © 2018 by the authors.

Anthropological and sociological research has illuminated the role and impact of rapid point-of-care malaria testing. This paper expands our knowledge about the social implications of non-malarial POCT, using the case study of a C-reactive-protein point-of-care testing (CRP POCT) clinical trial with febrile patients at primary-care-level health centres in Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand. We investigate the social role of CRP POCT through its interactions with (a) the healthcare workers who use it, (b) the patients whose routine care is affected by the test, and (c) the existing patient-health system linkages that might resonate or interfere with CRP POCT. We conduct a thematic analysis of data from 58 purposively sampled pre- and post-intervention patients and healthcare workers in August 2016 and May 2017. We find widespread positive attitudes towards the test among patients and healthcare workers. Patients’ views are influenced by an understanding of CRP POCT as a comprehensive blood test that provides specific diagnosis and that corresponds to notions of good care. Healthcare workers use the test to support their negotiations with patients but also to legitimise ethical decisions in an increasingly restrictive antibiotic policy environment. We hypothesise that CRP POCT could entail greater patient adherence to recommended antibiotic treatment, but it could also encourage riskier health behaviour and entail potentially adverse equity implications for patients across generations and socioeconomic strata. Our empirical findings inform the clinical literature on increasingly propagated point-of-care biomarker tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions, and we contribute to the anthropological and sociological literature through a novel conceptualisation of the patient-health system interface as an activity space into which biomarker testing is introduced. © 2018",Antibiotic use; Antimicrobial resistance; Biomarker testing; C-reactive protein point-of-care testing; Primary care; Qualitative research; Social research; Thailand,C reactive protein; antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial activity; biomarker; developing world; health worker; primary health care; protein; qualitative analysis; research method; testing method; adult; antibiotic therapy; Article; case study; controlled study; female; health care personnel; health care policy; health care system; help seeking behavior; human; informed consent; intervention study; male; patient care; point of care testing; prescription; Thailand; thematic analysis; Chiang Rai; Northern Region [Thailand]; Thailand,Article

Besides biomedical research and political efforts, modern information technology is playing a key role in many attempts at fighting the disease. One of the barriers toward a successful mortality reduction has been inadequate malaria diagnosis in particular. To improve diagnosis, image analysis software and machine learning methods have been used to quantify parasitemia in microscopic blood slides. This article gives an overview of these techniques and discusses the current developments in image analysis and machine learning for microscopic malaria diagnosis. We organize the different approaches published in the literature according to the techniques used for imaging, image preprocessing, parasite detection and cell segmentation, feature computation, and automatic cell classification. Readers will find the different techniques listed in tables, with the relevant articles cited next to them, for both thin and thick blood smear images.

Recently we have identified multiple proteins as targets of immunity against Plasmodium falciparum using African serum samples. To investigate whether potential targets of clinical immunity differ with transmission intensity, we assessed immune responses in residents of low malaria transmission region in Thailand. Malaria asymptomatic volunteers (Asy: n = 19) and symptomatic patients (Sym: n = 21) were enrolled into the study. Serum immunoreactivity to 186 wheat germ cell-free system (WGCFS)-synthesized recombinant P. falciparum asexual-blood stage proteins were determined by AlphaScreen, and subsequently compared between the study groups. Forty proteins were determined as immunoreactive with antibody responses to 35 proteins being higher in Asy group than in Sym group. Among the 35 proteins, antibodies to MSP3, MSPDBL1, RH2b, and MSP7 were significantly higher in Asy than Sym (unadjusted p < 0.005) suggesting these antigens may have a protective role in clinical malaria. MSP3 reactivity remained significantly different between Asy and Sym groups even after multiple comparison adjustments (adjusted p = 0.033). Interestingly, while our two preceding studies using African sera were conducted differently (e.g., cross-sectional vs. longitudinal design, observed clinical manifestation vs. functional activity), those studies similarly identified MSP3 and MSPDBL1 as potential targets of protective immunity. This study further provides a strong rationale for the application of WGCFS-based immunoprofiling to malaria vaccine candidate and biomarker discovery even in low or reduced malaria transmission settings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Blood-stage vaccine; High-throughput immunoscreening; Malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; Thailand; Wheat germ cell-free system (WGCFS),malaria vaccine; adolescent; adult; African; antibody response; Article; asymptomatic infection; blood sampling; cell free system; child; clinical assessment; controlled study; cross-sectional study; endemic disease; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; follow up; human; humoral immunity; immunity; immunoreactivity; in vitro study; longitudinal study; major clinical study; malaria falciparum; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; observational study; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; protein analysis; resident; Thailand; volunteer; wheat germ,Article

Previous results have shown that AMPH-induced dopamine neurotransmitter release, reactive oxygen species formation, and degenerative protein aggregation lead to neuronal death. Melatonin, a powerful antioxidant, plays a role as a neuroprotective agent. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the protective effect of melatonin on AMPH-induced hippocampal damage in the postnatal rat acts through the dopaminergic pathway. Four-day-old postnatal rats were subcutaneously injected with 5-10 mg/kg AMPH and pretreated with 10 mg/kg melatonin prior to AMPH exposure for seven days. The results showed that melatonin decreased the AMPH-induced hippocampal neuronal degeneration in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3. Melatonin attenuated the reduction in the expression of hippocampal synaptophysin, PSD-95, α-synuclein, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor protein and mRNA caused by AMPH. Melatonin attenuated the AMPH-induced reduction in dopamine transporter (DAT) protein expression in the hippocampus and the reduction in mRNA expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Immunofluorescence demonstrated that melatonin not only prevented the AMPH-induced loss of DAT and NMDA receptor but also prevented AMPH-induced α-synuclein overexpression in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3. Melatonin decreased the AMPH-induced reduction in the protein and mRNA of the NMDA receptor downstream signaling molecule, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and the melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2). This study showed that melatonin prevented AMPH-induced toxicity in the hippocampus of postnatal rats possibly via its antioxidative effect and mitochondrial protection. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In the present study, SP extracted from a European red seaweed Irish moss Chondrus crispus was chemically analyzed, SP content extracted and the immune-response effect on wild Irish mussels Mytilus spp. investigated for the first time. A high percent yield of SP was extracted from C. crispus and the immune-stimulant activity of SP was assessed in a laboratory trial with mussels exposed to three different treatments of low (10 μg mL−1), medium (20 μg mL−1) and high (50 μg mL−1) SP dose concentrations and a control mussel group with no exposure to SP. An initial mussel sample was processed prior to the trial commencing and mussels were subsequently sampled on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 post SP exposure. Both cell, humoral and immune related gene responses including haemocyte cell viability, haemocyte counts, lysozyme activity and expression of immune related genes (defensin, mytimycin and lysozyme mRNA) were assessed. No mussel mortalities were observed in either the treated or non-treated groups. Mussels exposed with SP showed an increase in haemocyte cell viability and the total number of haemocytes compared to control mussels. Lysozyme activity was also higher in treated mussels. Additionally, up-regulated expression of defensin, mytimycin and lysozyme mRNA was observed in SP treated mussels shortly after exposure (on Days 1, 2, and 3) to SP. These results indicate that a high quality yield of SP can be readily extracted from C. crispus and more importantly based on the animal model used in this study, SP extracted from C. crispus can rapidly induce health enhancing activities in Mytilus spp. at a cellular, humoral and molecular level and with a prolonged effect up to ten days post treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Chondrus crispus; Immune responses; Mytilus spp; Sulfated polysaccharides,defensin; lysozyme; messenger RNA; mytimycin; polysaccharide sulfate; unclassified drug; aquaculture; Article; blood cell count; cell viability; Chondrus; Chondrus crispus; controlled study; enzyme activity; immune response; immune-related gene; immunostimulation; Mytilus; nonhuman; priority journal; seaweed; upregulation,Article

Materials and methods: A cross sectional design. Data collected from doctors using an anonymous online, questionnaire. Results: Hundred seventy-five from LMICs and 43 from HICs participated. Barriers in LMICs were lack of formal training (Likert score median 3 [inter quartile range 3]), lack of nurses (3[3]) and low wages (3[4]). Strategies for LMICs improvement were formal training of ICU staff (4[3]), an increase in number of ICU nurses (4[2]), collection of outcome data (3[4]), as well as maintenance of available equipment [3(3)]. The most useful role of HIC ICU staff was training of LMIC staff (4[2]). Donation of equipment [2(4)], drugs [2(4)], and supplies (2[4]) perceived to be of limited usefulness. The most striking difference between HIC and LMIC staff was the perception on the lack of physician leadership as an obstacle to ICU functioning (4[3] vs. 0[2], p < 0.005). Conclusion: LMICs ICU workers perceived lack of training, lack of nurses, and low wages as major barriers to functioning. Training, increase of nurse workforce, and collection of outcome data were proposed as useful strategies to improve LMIC ICU services. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",ICU workers; Improving ICU services; Perceptions; Resource-limited settings,adult; aged; anonymised data; Article; cross-sectional study; device maintenance; economic evaluation; health personnel attitude; high income country; human; intensive care unit; intensivist; leadership; low income country; middle aged; middle income country; nurse training; nursing shortage; physician attitude; questionnaire; salary; total quality management,Article

We investigated whether HTR2C:rs518147 (-697G/C), rs12836771 (A/G), LEP: rs7799039 (-2548G/A) and LEPR:rs1137101 (668A/G) are related to MS in psychotic disorder patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Methods: A cross-sectional study including 200 patients was conducted; genetic polymorphisms in HTR2C (rs518147 and rs12836771), LEP (rs7799039) and LEPR (rs1137101) were genotyped. The presence of MS was evaluated according to the 2005 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Asia criteria. The associations of genetic factors with the presence of MS are analysed. Key findings: Two SNPs in the HTR2C gene but not LEP and LEPR were associated with the presence of MS after adjustment for the combination of atypical antipsychotics. With respect to the effect of gender after treatment with risperidone and clozapine was statistically significant. Moreover, genotype combinations had no effect on MS. Conclusions: Therefore, HTR2C genetic variants may be involved in the susceptibility to MS in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Additionally, there was a gender effect in the presence of MS. No effect of LEP or LEPR polymorphisms or the combination of HTR2C-LEP and HTR2C-LEPR was observed for the presence of MS. © 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society",atypical antipsychotics; HTR2C; LEP; LEPR; metabolic syndrome,atypical antipsychotic agent; clozapine; leptin; leptin receptor; olanzapine; quetiapine; risperidone; adult; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease classification; disease predisposition; female; gene; genotype; HTR2C gene; human; International Diabetes Federation Asia criteria; LEP gene; LEPR gene; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; psychosis; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; Thailand,Article

Methods: We tested the adhesive Clearfil S3 Bond Plus and 4 derived experimental ‘LUB’ (‘Leuven Univesity Bond’) adhesives (all from Kuraray Noritake), namely ‘LUB-CQ/amine_high’ ‘LUB-CQ/amine_low’ ‘LUB-TPO_high’ and ‘LUB-TPO_low’ respectively containing 2.0 wt% camphorquinone (CQ) and 2.0 wt% EDMAB (amine), 0.35 wt% CQ and 0.35 wt% amine, 2.0 wt% TPO, and 0.35 wt% TPO. For DC, each adhesive was applied onto glass or dentin prior to being cured (Bluephase 20i; Ivoclar Vivadent: “high mode”) for 10 s. DC was measured at 5 min, 10 min, 1 h, 24 h and 1 week using micro-Raman spectroscopy (SENTERRA; BrukerOptik). For mini-iFT, each adhesive was bonded to 320-grit SiC-paper ground dentin and covered with composite (Z100; 3 M ESPE). The restored teeth were cut in sticks (1.5 × 2.0 × 16 mm), after which a single-gradient notch was prepared at the adhesive-dentin interface using a 150-μm diamond blade. The micro-specimens were loaded until failure in a 4-point bending test and the mini-iFT in term of KQvM was calculated. Results: DC was higher on dentin than on glass. All adhesives were adequately polymerized at 1 week, except for LUB-TPO_low. DC at 5 min was significantly higher for LUB-TPO_high than for both CQ/amine-based adhesives. The highest and most reliable mini-iFT was measured for LUB-CQ/amine_high, despite its 5-min DC was relatively low. No correlation between DC and mini-iFT was found. Significance: Curing of TPO-based adhesives is faster, but the dark cure of the CQ/amine-containing adhesives is more efficient. The differences in curing profiles do affect the mechanical properties of the resultant interfaces at dentin. © 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials",Adhesive; Bonding effectiveness; Degree of conversion; Dentin; Fracture toughness; Glass; Interfacial fracture toughness; Photoinitiator; Polymerization kinetics; TPO,Adhesives; Curing; Fracture; Glass; Glass bonding; Polymerization; Silicon carbide; Bonding effectiveness; Degree of conversion; Dentin; Interfacial fracture toughness; Photo-initiator; Polymerization kinetics; Fracture toughness,Article

Design This qualitative study generated data from semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. This study was conducted at a non-governmental paediatric hospital and in nearby villages in Siem Reap province, Cambodia. A total of ten semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted, involving 27 participants. Iterative data collection and analysis were performed concurrently. Data were analysed by thematic content analysis and the coding structure was developed using relevant literature. Results Participants did not have a clear understanding of what activities related to research compared with those for routine healthcare. Key attitudes towards research were responsibility and trust: personal (trust of the researcher directly) and institutional (trust of the institution as a whole). Villagers believe the village headman holds responsibility for community activities, while the village headman believes that this responsibility should be shared across all levels of the government system. Conclusions It is essential for researchers to understand the structure and relationship within the community they wish to work with in order to develop trust among community participants. This aids effective communication and understanding among all parties, enabling high quality ethical research to be conducted. © 2018 Pol et al.

This study reviewed the main contents of the NSP-AMR and the mandates of relevant implementing agencies and identified challenges and recommends actions to mitigate implementation gaps. Methods: This study analysed the contents of NSP-AMR, reviewed institutional mandates and assessed the implementation gaps among agencies responsible for NSP-AMR. Results: Two of six strategies are related to monitoring and surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial consumption in human and animal. Two other strategies aim to improve antibiotic stewardship and control the spread of AMR in both clinical and farm settings. The remaining two strategies aim to increase knowledge and public awareness on AMR and establish national governance for inter-sectoral actions. Strategies to overcome implementation challenges are sustaining cross-sectoral policy commitments, effective cross-sectoral coordination using One Health approach, generating evidence which guides policy implementation, and improving enforcement capacities in regulatory authorities. Conclusions: To address AMR, Thailand requires significant improvements in implementation capacities in two dimensions. First, technical capacities among implementing agencies are needed to translate policies into practice. Second, governance and organizational capacities enable effective multi-sectoral actions across human, animal, and environmental sectors. © 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health",Antimicrobial resistance; Health systems; National strategic plan; One health; Policy; Thailand,governance approach; health policy; law enforcement; national strategy; policy implementation; public health; Thailand; Animalia,Article

CU2551 has previously been identified and characterized as a photosynthetic microorganism with high potential for H2 production. In the present study, cells of Tetraspora CU2551 were entrapped and immobilized in an alginate matrix with the aim to analyze the effect of cell stacking and a reduced exposure of O2 to the cells. The results showed that the most favorable immobilization conditions were 4% (w/v) of final alginate concentration and a cell concentration of 0.125 mg cell dry wt/mL alginate with a bead diameter of 2.80–3.35 mm. The H2 production yields increased when the immobilized cells were incubated in S-deprived medium and this could be repeated at least for 3 production times. Maximal total H2 production reached 7.68 ± 0.88 mL H2/25 mL medium, corresponding to a rate of 1182.45 ± 24.40 nmol H2/h/mg DW. This production is about 6 times higher compared to by cells in suspension, 2–10 times higher when compared to by other green algae, and 10–50 times higher when comparing with cyanobacteria.

Elucidation of antibody effector functions responsible for protective immunity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition is a major goal for the HIV-1 vaccine field. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an important part of the host defense against pathogens; however, little is known about the role of vaccineelicited IgA and its capacity to mediate antiviral functions. To identify the antiviral functions of HIV-1-specific IgA elicited by vaccination, we cloned HIV-1 envelopespecific IgA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) by memory B cell cultures from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an RV144 vaccinee and produced two IgA clonal cell lines (HG129 and HG130) producing native, nonrecombinant IgA MAbs. The HG129 and HG130 MAbs mediated phagocytosis by monocytes, and HG129 blocked HIV-1 Env glycoprotein binding to galactosylceramide, an alternative HIV-1 receptor. These findings elucidate potential antiviral functions of vaccine-elicited HIV-1 envelope-specific IgA that may act to block HIV-1 acquisition at the portal of entry by preventing HIV-1 binding to galactosylceramide and mediating antibody Fc receptor-mediated virion phagocytosis. Furthermore, these findings highlight the complex and diverse interactions of vaccine-elicited IgA with pathogens that depend on IgA fine specificity and form (e.g., multimeric or monomeric) in the systemic circulation and mucosal compartments. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.",B cell; HIV-1; IgA; Monoclonal antibodies; Nonneutralizing antibodies; Vaccine; Vaccines,"Fc receptor; galactosylceramide; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin A antibody; virus envelope protein; blocking antibody; galactosylceramide; Human immunodeficiency virus antibody; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; immunoglobulin A; monoclonal antibody; antibody specificity; antibody titer; Article; binding site; clonal cell line; conformational transition; controlled study; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; memory cell; molecular recognition; monocyte; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; phagocytosis; priority journal; protein binding; protein protein interaction; virion; virus entry; virus neutralization; cell line; drug effects; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; immunology; phagocytosis; AIDS Vaccines; Antibodies, Blocking; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Cell Line; Galactosylceramides; HIV Antibodies; HIV-1; Humans; Immunoglobulin A; Phagocytosis",Article

To clarify the role that MVMS can play in supporting human health, a series of consensus statements was developed based on expert opinion. Methods: A panel of 14 international experts in nutritional science and health care was convened to develop consensus statements related to using MVMS in supporting optimal human health. The modified Delphi process included 2 rounds of remote voting and a final round of voting at a roundtable meeting where evidence summaries were presented and discussed. The level of agreement with each of 9 statements was rated on a 5-point Likert scale: agree strongly; agree with reservation; undecided; disagree; or disagree strongly. Consensus was predefined as ≥80% of the panel agreeing strongly or agreeing with reservation to a given statement. Findings: Consensus was reached for all statements. The panel determined that MVMS can broadly improve micronutrient intakes when they contain at least the micronutrients that are consumed insufficiently or have limited bioavailability within a specified population. MVMS formulations may also be individualized according to age, sex, life cycle, and/or other selected characteristics. There are specific biological processes and health outcomes associated with deficient, inadequate, and adequate micronutrient levels. Adequate intake is necessary for normal biological functioning required for good health; in some instances, higher than recommended micronutrient intakes have the potential to provide additional health benefits. Meeting daily intakes established by dietary reference values should be an explicit public health goal for individuals and populations. Use of MVMS is one approach to ensure that adequate micronutrient needs are met in support of biological functions necessary to maintain health. Long-term use of MVMS not exceeding the upper limit of recommended intakes has been determined to be safe in healthy adults. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that MVMS are effective for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, for certain otherwise healthy subpopulations (eg, pregnant women, older adults) and some individuals with existing medical conditions who experience inadequacies in micronutrient intake, addressing inadequacies by using MVMS can provide health benefits. Implications: This consensus panel has described key issues related to the use of MVMS among individuals at risk of or presenting with inadequacies in micronutrient intake or biomarker status. © 2018 The Authors",adverse effects; Delphi consensus; dietary supplements; health benefits; multivitamin/multimineral supplements; nutrition,mineral; multimineral; multivitamin; unclassified drug; vitamin; adult; age; breast feeding; child; diet supplementation; dietary supplement; eye disease; health care; human; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; normal human; nutritional science; obesity; pregnant woman; Review; women's health,Review

A major gap in the field is the identification of diverse HIV-1 envelope antigens to evaluate vaccine regimens for binding antibody breadth. In this study, we define unique antigen panels to map HIV-1 vaccine-elicited antibody breadth and durability. Diverse HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins were selected based on genetic and geographic diversity to cover the global epidemic, with a focus on sexually acquired transmitted/founder viruses with a tier 2 neutralization phenotype. Unique antigenicity was determined by nonredundancy (Spearman correlation), and antigens were clustered using partitioning around medoids (PAM) to identify antigen diversity. Cross-validation demonstrated that the PAM method was better than selection by reactivity and random selection. Analysis of vaccine-elicited V1V2 binding antibody in longitudinal samples from the RV144 clinical trial revealed the striking heterogeneity among individual vaccinees in maintaining durable responses. These data support the idea that a major goal for vaccine development is to improve antibody levels, breadth, and durability at the population level. Elucidating the level and durability of vaccine-elicited binding antibody breadth needed for protection is critical for the development of a globally efficacious HIV vaccine. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.",Antibody; Antigenicity; Diversity; Durability; HIV-1; Humoral immunity; Vaccine,"glycoprotein gp 120; gp120 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus antibody; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; animal; genetic variation; genetics; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunology; rhesus monkey; AIDS Vaccines; Animals; Genetic Variation; HIV Antibodies; HIV Envelope Protein gp120; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Macaca mulatta",Article
