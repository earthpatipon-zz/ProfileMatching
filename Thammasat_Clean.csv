Differences in antibiotic selection in clinical practice exist according to obstetricians' preferences despite clear guidelines on preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of ampicillin and ceftriaxone in preventing cesarean SSIs. Methods: The observational prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Thailand from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012. Propensity scores for ceftriaxone prophylaxis were calculated from potential influencing confounders. The cesarean SSI rates of the ceftriaxone group vs. those of the ampicillin prophylactic group were estimated by multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression nested by propensity score. Results: Data of 4149 cesarean patients were collected. Among these, 911 patients received ceftriaxone whereas 3238 patients received ampicillin as preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence of incisional SSIs was (0.1% vs. 1.2%; p = 0.001) and organ space SSIs was (1.2% vs. 2.9%; p = 0.003) in the ceftriaxone group compared with the ampicillin group. After adjusting for confounders, the rate ratios of incisional and organ/space SSIs in the ceftriaxone compared with the ampicillin group did not differ (RR, 0.23; 95% CI 0.03-1.78), and (RR, 1.62; 95% CI 0.83-3.18), respectively. Conclusion: These data indicate no difference exists between ampicillin and ceftriaxone to prevent SSIs after cesarean section. Ampicillin may be used as antibiotic prophylaxis in cesarean section. © 2018 The Author(s).",Ampicillin; Ceftriaxone; Cesarean infections; Observational study; Propensity score,ampicillin; ceftriaxone; adult; antibiotic prophylaxis; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterium isolation; cesarean section; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; female; follow up; human; incidence; infection prevention; major clinical study; nonhuman; observational study; preoperative treatment; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; surgical infection; survival rate; tertiary care center; Thailand,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040861095

This paper, therefore, determines the priorities of sustainable supply chain management focusing on eco-design. Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and Matriced’ Impacts Croise’s Multiplication Appliquée a UN Classement (MIMAC) are used to identify the hierarchical structure of the relationships among eco-design dimensions, and to analyse characteristics power of each dimension on supporting eco-design practices. The relationships and characteristics power of each dimension are used to determine indicators that are effective in enhancement of eco-design practice, evaluated through sustainable supply chain performance. Results indicate that product deployment is an important approach for improving eco-design practice towards sustainable supply chain management. This emphasises the purpose and impact of eco-design on sequential supply chain activities at deployment phase. Further research is required to make an overall assessment of eco-design practices across range of manufacturing industries, given the current research is based on inputs from a limited number of experts of selected organisations. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",dimensions; eco-design; ISM; Sustainable supply chain; triple bottom line,Ecodesign; Industrial research; Product design; Sustainable development; dimensions; Hierarchical structures; Interpretive structural modelling (ISM); Manufacturing industries; Supply chain performance; Sustainable practices; Sustainable supply chains; Triple Bottom Line; Supply chain management,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030719865

A parasitological investigation was conducted in Ban Lak Sip village, Luang Prabang, Lao PDR involving fecal samples from 305 inhabitants as well as water samples taken from 3 sites of the local stream. Water analysis indicated the presence of several enteric pathogens, i.e., Aeromonas spp., Vibrio spp., E. coli H7, E. coli O157: H7, verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC), Shigella spp., and enteric adenovirus. The level of microbial pathogens contamination was associated with human activity, with greater levels of contamination found at the downstream site compared to the site at the village and upstream, respectively. Regarding intestinal parasites, the prevalence of helminth and protozoan infections were 68.9% and 27.2%, respectively. Eight helminth taxa were identified in fecal samples, i.e., 2 tapeworm species (Taenia sp. and Hymenolepis diminuta), 1 trematode (Opisthorchis sp.), and 5 nematodes (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Strongyloides stercoralis, trichostrongylids, and hookworms). Six species of intestinal protists were identified, i.e., Blastocystis hominis, Cyclospora spp., Endolimax nana, Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar, Entamoeba coli, and Giardia lamblia. Questionnaires and interviews were also conducted to determine risk factors of infection. These analyses together with a prevailing infection level suggested that most of villagers were exposed to parasites in a similar degree due to limited socio-economic differences and sharing of similar practices. Limited access to effective public health facilities is also a significant contributing factor. © 2017, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine.",Ascaris lumbricoides; Blastocystis hominis; Cyclospora sp; Endolimax nana; Entamoeba coli; Entamoeba histolytica; Environment; Giardia lamblia; Hookworm; Lao PDR; Opisthorchis sp; Risk factor; Strongyloides stercoralis; Taenia sp; Trichuris trichiura; Water,"adolescent; adult; Article; cestode; eating habit; epidemic; feces analysis; female; helminth; helminthiasis; hookworm; human; human activities; hygiene; infection risk; intestine infection; intestine parasite; Laos; major clinical study; male; microbial contamination; nematode; nonhuman; parasite examination; parasite prevalence; parasitosis; protist; protozoon; rural area; sex difference; socioeconomics; trematode; water analysis; water contamination; child; epidemic; feces; intestine infection; microbiology; middle aged; parasitology; prevalence; questionnaire; risk factor; rural population; statistics and numerical data; water pollution; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Disease Outbreaks; Feces; Female; Humans; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic; Laos; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution; Young Adult",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033362958

This synchronisation involves switching on and off their gonadotrophic axis. Ever since their discovery as key regulators of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurones, the hypothalamic RF-amide peptides kisspeptin and RFamide-related peptide (RFRP) have been a major focus of research on the seasonal regulation of the gonadotrophic axis. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of both neuropeptides in the Djungarian hamster, a major animal model for the study of seasonal reproduction. During the long-day breeding period, kisspeptin neurones in the anteroventral periventricular area are solely controlled by a positive sex steroid feedback and, in the arcuate nucleus, they are subject to a very strong negative sex steroid feedback associated with a minor photoperiodic effect. During short-day sexual quiescence, the disappearance of this hormonal feedback leads to high levels of kisspeptin in arcuate neurones. Notably, chronic central administration of kisspeptin is able to over-ride the photoperiodic inhibition of the gonadotrophic axis and reactivate the reproductive function. Therefore, our data suggest that kisspeptin secretion by arcuate neurones during sexual quiescence is inhibited by mechanisms upstream of kisspeptin neurones. RFRP expression is solely controlled by photoperiod, being strongly reduced in short days independently of the sex steroid feedback. Thus, kisspeptin and RFRP display contrasting patterns of expression and regulation. Upstream mechanisms controlling these neurones should be the focus of further studies on the roles of these RFamide neuropeptides in the seasonal control of reproduction. © 2017 British Society for Neuroendocrinology",gonadotrophin-releasing hormone; kisspeptin; photoperiod; RF-amide-3; sex steroids,arginylphenylalanine amide related peptide; kisspeptin; kisspeptin 10; neuropeptide; sex hormone; unclassified drug; animal experiment; arcuate nucleus; Article; controlled study; dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus; feedback system; immunocytochemistry; immunoreactivity; light dark cycle; limit of quantitation; male; mediobasal hypothalamus; negative feedback; nerve cell; nonhuman; photoperiodicity; positive feedback; priority journal; protein expression; protein secretion; reproduction; seminal vesicle; Siberian hamster; stria terminalis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029954927

Material and Method: Fifty-two sandstone workers with an ILO classification chest radiographs profusion CAG =1/1, FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) that decline as measured using follow-up FVC maneuver spirometry testing were interviewed. Work exposure, personal protective equipment, and symptoms (if any) obtained through questionnaire was also included. Results: The 52 participants mostly were female, average age 48±8.9 years, and mostly non-smokers. Mean of FEV1 decline at one-year follow-up was 105.4±131.7 mL (95% CI 68.7, 142.0) with increasing of FEV1 decline among high exposure, smokers and exposed for 10 years or more. The mean FEV1 decline among workers with all those factors was 272.0±155.5 mL. Subgroup analysis with independent t-test and multiple linear regression models revealed only FEV1 decline was found in high exposure group. FVC decline trended similar to FEV1 decline. Mean of FVC loss was 119.4±181.1 mL (95% CI 69.0, 169.9), while mean FVC loss among those classified as high exposure smoking workers with 10 years or more of exposure was 376.0±216.2 mL. However, the FEV1 and FVC declined among sandstone workers were at least three times greater than Thai physiological decline. Conclusion: Although ILO chest radiographs were normal or near normal, the FEV1 and FVC declined among silica dust exposed workers. Therefore, FEV1 deterioration should be monitored in order to comply with the UK RCS Dust Exposed Surveillance Guideline, especially among high exposure. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

P3P is a privacy policy language with a fixed vocabulary to express privacy practices of online services. The matching between the privacy practices (P3P policies) and users’ privacy preferences facilitates the users to be aware of services’ usage of their data. However, the change from single to composite online services raises more privacy concern due to the increasing amount of user data being collected, stored and shared. This change impacts on P3P since it was designed from a single service perspective. In addition, P3P allows the specification of policies containing semantic inconsistencies. In this paper, we extend P3P to be suitable for composite services and propose a formal semantics for P3P using OWL to facilitate reasoning about semantic ambiguities in P3P policies. The constraints defined in our ontology are used to verify potential semantic inconsistencies and to check for conflicts occurring from P3P policies of service members.

Resolving these limitations requires an alternative in vitro model to uncover the primary response profiles. Methods: A novel in vitro model of mononuclear cells (MNCs) generated from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) was developed and these cells were then co-cultured with various antigens from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax to investigate the response of naïve immune cells to malaria antigens by flow cytometry. Results: In vitro stimulation of naïve lymphocytes showed that CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly reduced (P < 0.01) by exposure to lysates of infected erythrocytes or intact erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum. The depletion was associated with the expression of CD95 (Fas receptor) on the surface of T lymphocytes. Maturation of T lymphocytes was affected differently, showing elevated CD3+CD4+CD8+ and CD3+CD4−CD8− T lymphocytes after stimulation with cell lysates of P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. In addition, antigen presenting monocytes and dendritic cells derived from haematopoietic stem cells showed impaired HLA-DR expression as a consequence of exposure to different species of malaria parasites. Conclusion: These results suggest that naïve mononuclear cells differentiated in vitro from HSCs could provide a valid model for the assessment of immunity.

Optimum temperature for the J12 CMCase and xylanase acitvities were found to be the same at 60°C. But optimum pH were slightly different at pH 6.0 and 5.5, respectively. Both enzymes were stable at high temperatures and retained more than 60 % of their activities after 20 min at 60°C.

Microbiome-directed therapies are increasingly used preoperatively and postoperatively to improve postoperative outcomes. Recently, the effectiveness of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in reducing postoperative complications (POCs) has been questioned. This systematic review aimed to examine and rank the effectiveness of these therapies on POCs in adult surgical patients. Methods. We searched for articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL plus. From 2002 to 2015, 31 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were identified in the literature. Risk of bias and heterogeneity were assessed. Network meta-analyses (NMA) were performed using random-effects modeling to obtain estimates for study outcomes. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. We then ranked the comparative effects of all regimens with the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Results. A total of 2,952 patients were included. We found that synbiotic therapy was the best regimen in reducing surgical site infection (SSI) (RR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.64) in adult surgical patients. Synbiotic therapy was also the best intervention to reduce pneumonia (RR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09-0.90), sepsis (RR = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.94), hospital stay (mean = 9.66 days, 95% CI, 7.60- 11.72), and duration of antibiotic administration (mean = 5.61 days, 95% CI, 3.19-8.02). No regimen significantly reduced mortality. Conclusions. This network meta-analysis suggests that synbiotic therapy is the first rank to reduce SSI, pneumonia, sepsis, hospital stay, and antibiotic use. Surgeons should consider the use of synbiotics as an adjunctive therapy to prevent POCs among adult surgical patients. Increasing use of synbiotics may help to reduce the use of antibiotics and multidrug resistance. © The Author 2017.

Data on secondary CNS (SCNS) relapse were mostly obtained from western countries with limited data from developing countries. We analyzed the data of 2034 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients enrolled into the multi-center registry under Thai Lymphoma Study Group from setting. The incidence, September 2006 to December 2013 to represent outcome from a resource limited pattern, management, and outcome of SCNS relapse were described. The 2-year cumulative incidence (CI) of SCNS relapse was 2.7 %. A total of 729, 1024, and 281 patients were classified as low-, intermediate-, and high-risk CNS international prognostic index (CNS-IPI) with corresponding 2-year CI of SCNS relapse of 1.5, 3.1, and 4.6 %, respectively (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis demonstrated advance stage disease, poor performance status, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, presence of B symptoms, more than one extranodal organ involvement, high IPI, and high CNS-IPI group as predictive factors for SCNS relapse. Rituximab exposure and intrathecal chemoprophylaxis offered no protective effect against SCNS relapse. At the time of analysis, six patients were alive. Median OS in SCNS relapsed patients was significantly shorter than relapsed patients without CNS involvement (13.2 vs 22.6 months) (p < 0.001). Primary causes of death were progressive disease (n = 35, 63.6 %) and infection (n = 9, 16.7 %). In conclusion, although the incidence of SCNS relapse in our cohort was low, the prognosis was dismal. Prophylaxis for SCNS involvement was underused even in high-risk patients. Novel approaches for SCNS relapse prophylaxis and managements are warranted. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",CNS prophylaxis; CNS-IPI; Diffuse large B cell lymphoma; Secondary CNS relapse,"cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; doxorubicin; lactate dehydrogenase; methotrexate; prednisolone; rituximab; vincristine; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer prevention; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; cause of death; central nervous system metastasis; chemoprophylaxis; clinical outcome; controlled study; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; drug exposure; drug megadose; encephale isole; female; follow up; high risk patient; human; induction chemotherapy; intermediate risk patient; International Prognostic Index; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; leptomeninx; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; medical record review; multiple cycle treatment; overall survival; paranasal sinus; priority journal; progression free survival; skull irradiation; systemic disease; Thailand; treatment response; Central Nervous System Neoplasms; clinical trial; health care planning; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; middle aged; multicenter study; prospective study; register; trends; tumor recurrence; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Central Nervous System Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Resources; Humans; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prospective Studies; Registries; Thailand; Young Adult",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991660172

To solve such a problem, we propose a novel contrast enhancement method based on a non-linear scaling function and the singular value decomposition (SVD). The SVD is used to decompose the image into several layers. Some layers are associated with the less-visible areas. Then, such layers are strengthened by using a proposed logarithmic-scaling function. To reduce the effect of over-enhancement that might occur due to our function, the pyramid-based blending scheme is deployed. The evaluation results show that our proposed method can successfully improve the local content without amplifying noise. It also preserves the tone, the key-lighting, and the texture of the original image. © 2016 IEEE.",,Computer programming; Computer science; Contrast Enhancement; Evaluation results; Local contents; Logarithmic scaling; nocv1; Non-linear scaling; Original images; Singular value decomposition,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011032484

Reactive nitrogen, in an intermediate form of nitric oxide (NO), is one of the first lines of defense used by host cells to eliminate intracellular pathogens, through the stimulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Studies in phagocytotic cells have shown that the iNOS response is muted in B. pseudomallei infection, and implicated the rpoS sigma factor as a key regulatory factor mediating suppression. The liver is a main visceral organ affected by B. pseudomallei, and there is little knowledge about the interaction of liver cells and B. pseudomallei. This study investigated the induction of iNOS, as well as autophagic flux and light-chain 3 (LC3) localization in human liver (HC04) cells in response to infection with B. pseudomallei and its rpoS deficient mutant. Results showed that the rpoS mutant was unable to suppress iNOS induction and that the mutant showed less induction of autophagy and lower co-localization with LC3, and this was coupled with a lower intracellular growth rate. Combining these results suggest that B. pseudomallei rpoS is an important factor in establishing infection in liver cells. © FEMS 2016.",Burkholderia pseudomallei; Hepatocyte; Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); Melioidosis; RpoS,"inducible nitric oxide synthase; sigma factor RpoS; bacterial protein; inducible nitric oxide synthase; light chain 3, human; microtubule associated protein; sigma factor; sigma factor KatF protein, Bacteria; Article; autophagy; bacterial growth; bacterial infection; Burkholderia pseudomallei; controlled study; enzyme induction; enzyme inhibition; HC04 cell line; human; human cell; liver cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein localization; biosynthesis; Burkholderia pseudomallei; cell line; enzymology; genetics; growth, development and aging; host pathogen interaction; liver cell; melioidosis; metabolism; microbial viability; microbiology; mutation; Autophagy; Bacterial Proteins; Burkholderia pseudomallei; Cell Line; Enzyme Induction; Hepatocytes; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Melioidosis; Microbial Viability; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Mutation; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II; Sigma Factor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982921052

HN30 and HN4 were derived from primary lesions in the pharynx and base of tongue, respectively, and HN31 and HN12 were derived from lymph-node metastatic lesions belonging to the same patients. Gain of chromosome 1, 7, and 11 were shared in almost all cell lines. Hierarchical clustering revealed that HN31 was closely related to HN4, which shared eight chromosome alteration cases. Large C-positive heterochromatins were found in the centromeric region of chromosome 9 in HN31 and HN4, which suggests complex structural amplification of the repetitive sequence. Array CGH revealed amplification of 7p22.3p11.2, 8q11.23q12.1, and 14q32.33 in all cell lines involved with tumorigenesis and inflammation genes. The amplification of 2p21 (SIX3), 11p15.5 (H19), and 11q21q22.3 (MAML2, PGR, TRPC6, and MMP family) regions, and deletion of 9p23 (PTPRD) and 16q23.1 (WWOX) regions were identified in HN31 and HN12. Interestingly, partial loss of PTPRD (9p23) and WWOX (16q23.1) genes was identified in HN31 and HN12, and the level of gene expression tended to be the down-regulation of PTPRD, with no detectable expression of the WWOX gene. This suggests that the scarcity of PTPRD and WWOX genes might have played an important role in progression of HNSCC, and could be considered as a target for cancer therapy or a biomarker in molecular pathology. ï¿½ 2016 Singchat et al.

In this study, the rice husk was extracted for the contained silica by pretreatment with hydrochloric and calcination at 700 °C, and the white rice husk ash (WRA) mainly consisting of the silica was finally obtained. WRA was then investigated for its composition and structure with X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The results showed that WRA contained a large amount of silica (90%) with amorphous structure. After that, WRA was used as filler for the preparation of natural rubber products. Two kinds of the natural rubber products were prepared here: 1) the pure natural rubber (PNR) product and 2) the deproteinized natural rubber (DNR) product. DNR was a protein removal natural rubber, which is suitable for use as a dental material with the low allergenic properties caused from the proteins. Additionally, DNR used in this study could be provided by removing proteins from the natural rubber latex with 0.1 % urea in the presence of surfactant at room temperature. It was found that the nitrogen content (main element of proteins) of DNR was lower than PNR under the test condition. For the preparation of natural rubber products, WRA was mixed into the PNR and DNR latexes comparing with the commercial silica (Hisil-233). All finished latexes were compounded to obtain the natural rubber products. The viscoelastic properties and the cure characteristics of the entire products were investigated.

Purified human B cells from healthy volunteers were stimulated through the B Cell Receptor with Anti-IgM + anti-CD40 + IL21 in the absence / presence of TAC or SRL. A variety of parameters of B cell activity including activation, differentiation, cytokine productions and proliferation were monitored by flow cytometry. SRL at clinically relevant concentrations (6 ng/ml) profoundly inhibited CD19+ B cell proliferation compared to controls whereas TAC at similar concentrations had a minimal effect. CD27+ memory B cells were affected more by SRL than naïve CD27- B cells. SRL effectively blocked B cell differentiation into plasma cells (CD19+CD138+ and Blimp1+/Pax5low cells) even at low dose (2 ng/ml), and totally eliminated them at 6 ng/ml. SRL decreased absolute B cell counts, but the residual responding cells acquired an activated phenotype (CD25+/CD69+) and increased the expression of HLA-DR. SRL-treated stimulated B cells on a per cell basis were able to enhance the proliferation of allogeneic CD4+CD25- T cells and induce a shift toward the Th1 phenotype. Thus, SRL and TAC have different effects on B lymphocytes. These data may provide insights into the clinical use of these two agents in recipients of solid organ transplants.

The free and in situ films containing 10 and 20% additives by weight of polymer were prepared by spray method. The mechanical properties of both HPMC and EC free films decreased as the concentration of additives was increased because of the lower stiffening effect brought about by hydrodynamic or reinforcing effect. However, adhesive toughness of in situ films was found to increase for HPMC whereas that of EC films decreased with the increasing concentration of polymeric additives. Such contradictory results between these two film forming polymers may be attributed to the net result of the opposite effects between interference of film-tablet interfacial bonds and the reduction of mechanical properties. The former seemed to be preferential in the case of EC films, while the latter predominated for HPMC films. Such conclusions were supported by the FTIR results, in which the polymer-additive interaction was found for EC. Increase in concentration of polymeric additives resulted in the decrease in mechanical properties of free films whereas the adhesive toughness of in situ films may be influenced by either the interference of film-tablet interfacial bonds or the significant reduction of mechanical properties.",,ethyl cellulose; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; magnesium stearate; polymer; starch; cellulose; excipient; polymer; tablet; Article; controlled study; film coating; hydrodynamics; infrared spectroscopy; mechanics; tablet disintegration time; tablet hardness; tablet thickness; tensile strength; Young modulus; adhesion; chemistry; elasticity; hardness; tablet; Adhesiveness; Cellulose; Elasticity; Excipients; Hardness; Polymers; Tablets; Tensile Strength,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930665703

Gamboge has been also used as a folk medicine for an internal purgative and externally infected wound. We focused on the mechanisms of apoptosis induction by GA through the unfold protein response (ER stress) in HeLa cells. Methods: The cytotoxic effect of GA against HeLa cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Markers of ER stress such as XBP-1, GRP78, CHOP, GADD34 and ERdj4 were analyzed by RT-PCR and Real-time RT-PCR. Cell morphological changes and apoptotic proteins were performed by Hoechst33342 staining and Western blotting technique. Results: Our results indicated a time- and dose-dependent decrease of cell viability by GA. The ER stress induction is determined by the up-regulation of spliced XBP1 mRNA and activated GRP78, CHOP, GADD34 and ERdj4 expression. GA also induced cell morphological changes such as nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing and apoptotic body in Hela cells. Apoptosis cell death detected by increased DR5, caspase-8, -9, and -3 expression as well as increased cleaved-PARP, while decreased Bcl-2 upon GA treatment. In addition, phosphorylated JNK was up-regulated but phosphorylated ERK was down-regulated after exposure to GA. Conclusions: These results suggest that GA induce apoptosis associated with the ER stress response through up-regulation of p-JNK and down-regulation of p-ERK in HeLa cells. © 2015 Krajarng et al.",Anticancer; Apoptosis; ER stress; Gambogic acid; HeLa cells,"BIM protein; caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; death receptor 5; endoplasmic reticulum localized DnaJ homologue protein; gambogic acid; glucose regulated protein 78; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 34; hoe 33342; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; nucleic acid binding protein; procaspase 3; procaspase 8; procaspase 9; protein bcl 2; protein DnaJ; stress activated protein kinase; tunicamycin; unclassified drug; X box binding protein 1; antineoplastic agent; gambogic acid; heat shock protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; molecular chaperone GRP78; plant extract; stress activated protein kinase; xanthone derivative; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; binding site; bright field microscopy; cancer cell culture; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation; cell structure; cell survival; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; DNA flanking region; down regulation; endoplasmic reticulum stress; enzyme phosphorylation; female; fluorescence microscopy; Garcinia; Garcinia hanburyi; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein localization; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; uterine cervix cancer; Western blotting; apoptosis; chemistry; drug effects; metabolism; phytotherapy; transcription initiation; upregulation; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Cell Survival; Down-Regulation; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Female; Garcinia; Heat-Shock Proteins; HeLa Cells; Humans; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Transcriptional Activation; Up-Regulation; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Xanthones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924338427

Aims: We describe the trends in the clinical presentation of Asian patients who had cutaneous adverse events induced by epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and to explore the relationship between skin adverse events and tumor response. Methods: From 2006 to 2010, medical records of Thai patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors were retrieved and analyzed. Results: In all, 99 patients were reviewed and analyzed. Erlotinib and gefitinib were commenced in 75 (75.8%) and 24 (24.2%) patients, respectively. Cutaneous adverse events occurred in 43 (57.3%) patients receiving erlotinib and in 15 (62.5%) patients receiving gefitinib. The most common adverse event was xerosis (52.5%). Less common adverse events included papulo-pustular eruption (27.3%), erythematous maculopapular rash (11.1%), mucositis (6.7%), paronychia (5.1%), and trichomegaly (2%). Elderly patients had a higher occurrence of xerosis. The presence of cutaneous adverse events was significantly higher in subjects who had a tumor response. Limitations: The limitations of study include its retrospective nature, and the initial screening of cutaneous adverse events was done by non-dermatologists. Conclusions: Cutaneous adverse events due to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are not uncommon in the Asian population. We found a positive correlation between the occurrences of cutaneou adverse events and tumor response supporting the view that they are surrogate markers for therapeutic response. © 2015 Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology, and Leprology.",Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors; erlotinib; gefitinib; papulopustular eruption; xerosis,"benzoyl peroxide; corticosteroid; doxycycline; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; erlotinib; gefitinib; petrolatum; triamcinolone; urea derivative; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; gefitinib; quinazoline derivative; adult; Article; Asian; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; clinical feature; corticosteroid therapy; cutaneous adverse event; cutaneous adverse event; drug dose reduction; drug hypersensitivity; eyelid disease; female; geriatric patient; human; maculopapular rash; major clinical study; male; medical record review; mucosa inflammation; non small cell lung cancer; paronychia; pustule; retrospective study; skin allergy; treatment duration; treatment response; trend study; trichomegaly; xerosis; antagonists and inhibitors; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; chemically induced; Drug Eruptions; follow up; Lung Neoplasms; metabolism; middle aged; Skin Diseases, Papulosquamous; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Drug Eruptions; Erlotinib Hydrochloride; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Quinazolines; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Retrospective Studies; Skin Diseases, Papulosquamous",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940734343

Our study objective is to identify whether pretransplant malignancy increases the risk for posttransplant malignancy. METHODS: Using the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database, adult (≥18 years old) recipients of a primary orthotopic heart transplant performed between 2000 and 2012 were included. The cohort was stratified according to the presence and type of pretransplant malignancy. Outcomes were posttransplant overall, skin, solid malignancies, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Incidence of and time to first posttransplant malignancy, accounting for death as a competing event, were calculated. Fine and Gray competing risks regression was performed to examine risk factors associated with posttransplant malignancy. RESULTS: Of 23,171 recipients, overall posttransplant malignancy was diagnosed in 2673 recipients (11.5%).The median time to overall, skin, solid posttransplant malignancies, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder were 3.2 (1.6-5.7), 3.2 (1.7-5.6), 3.5 (1.7-5.9), and 2.5 years(0.8-5.2), respectively. Pretransplant malignancy increased the risk of posttransplant overall (subhazard ratio [SHR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.27-1.81), skin (SHR, 1.55, 95% CI, 1.23-1.93), and solid organ malignancies (SHR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.13-2.11). Pretransplant skin malignancy increased the risk of posttransplant skin malignancy (SHR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.82-4.28). Pretransplant solid malignancy also increased the risk of posttransplant skin malignancy (SHR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.07-2.25) but not of posttransplant solid tumors (SHR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.69-2.19). Older, male, and white were also risk factors for posttransplant malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: A history of any pretransplant malignancy was associated with increased risks of skin and solid malignancies after transplantation. The specific type of posttransplant malignancy risk differed according to the type of pretransplant malignancy. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Materials and methods Retrospective cohort study comprised adult patients who underwent abdominal CT for suspected acute appendicitis between January 2006 and December 2009. Two abdominal radiologists independently reviewed the CT scans; any discrepancies were resolved by a consensus review. Alvarado scores were calculated and categorized as low (0-3), equivocal (4-6), or high (7-10) probability for appendicitis. The diagnostic utility of CT scans and Alvarado score for acute appendicitis were compared with the criterion standard of combined medical chart review and pathology findings. Results In a cohort of 158 subjects, 73 (46.2%) had clinical diagnoses of acute appendicitis. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CT scan in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were 97.5%, 98.6%, 96.5%, 96.0%, and 98.8%, respectively. The mean Alvarado score for subjects with complicated appendicitis was significantly higher (7.95) than subjects with uncomplicated appendicitis (6.67) and those with other diagnoses (5.95). Acute appendicitis was confirmed in 2 (13.3%) of 15 subjects with low probability Alvarado scores, 16 (30.8%) of 52 subjects with equivocal scores, and 55 (60.4%) of 91 subjects with high probability scores. Conclusion The CT scan had high diagnostic utility for acute appendicitis. The Alvarado score was not a reliable independent predictive tool for acute appendicitis and could not replace CT scan. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

As their effects on immune cells and allograft molecular profiles have not been elucidated, we characterized the effects of tacrolimus to sirolimus conversion on the frequency and function of T cells, and on graft molecular profiles. Samples from renal transplant patients in a randomized trial of 18 patients with late sirolimus conversion and 12 on tacrolimus maintenance were utilized. Peripheral blood was collected at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months post randomization, with T-cell subpopulations analyzed by flow cytometry and T-cell alloreactivity tested by IFN-γ ELISPOT. Graft biopsy samples obtained 24 months post randomization were used for gene expression analysis. Sirolimus conversion led to an increase in CD4 + 25 +++ Foxp3 + regulatory T cells. While tacrolimus-maintained patients showed a decrease in indirect alloreactivity over time post transplant, sirolimus conversion increased indirect alloreactive T-cell frequencies compared with tacrolimus-maintained patients. No histological differences were found in graft biopsies, but molecular profiles showed activation of the antigen presentation, IL-12 signaling, oxidative stress, macrophage-derived production pathways, and increased inflammatory and immune response in sirolimus-converted patients. Thus, chronic immune alterations are induced after sirolimus conversion. Despite the molecular profile being favorable to calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen, there was no impact in renal function over 30 months of follow-up. © 2015 International Society of Nephrology.",,"alemtuzumab; interleukin 12; rapamycin; tacrolimus; gamma interferon; immunosuppressive agent; interleukin 12; rapamycin; tacrolimus; adult; alloimmunity; antigen presentation; Article; biopsy; clinical article; controlled study; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; flow cytometry; glomerulus filtration rate; graft recipient; histopathology; human; human tissue; immune response; immunosuppressive treatment; kidney graft rejection; kidney transplantation; lymphocyte function; macrophage; male; oxidative stress; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); regulatory T lymphocyte; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; allograft; blood; CD4 lymphocyte count; drug effects; drug substitution; gene expression; gene expression profiling; genetics; graft survival; histocompatibility; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; randomized controlled trial; Adult; Allografts; Antigen Presentation; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Drug Substitution; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Graft Survival; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-12; Kidney Transplantation; Macrophages; Male; Middle Aged; Oxidative Stress; Signal Transduction; Sirolimus; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Tacrolimus; Transplantation Immunology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926520181

These enzyme inhibitors were reported to be found in many plants. Apai-sa-le recipe was a Thai tradition used as nootropic recipe and formerly claimed to improve memory. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate cholinesterase inhibitory activity of the recipe and its ingredients. Objective: To determine the whole recipe of Apai-sa-le and its ingredients for inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and human butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities. Material and Method: Thirty grams of each plant and 181 grams of the whole recipe were separately extracted by 95% ethanol, after filtered the filtrate were evaporated and vacuum-dried at 45°C. By Elman method, the inhibitory activities of both enzymes were assessed. The volatile constituents of each extract were determined by GCMS. The constituents in the nonvolatile extract were examined by TLC and the antioxidant activity was determined. Results: Four plants exhibited specific BuChE inhibitor were Lepidium sativum Linn. (Ls), Piper nigrum L. (Pn), Angelica dahurica Benth (Ad) and Atractylodes lancea DC. (Al), which shown the IC<inf>50</inf> of 5.59, 24.52, 73.23, 96.25 μg/ml, respectively whereas galantamine and the whole recipe showed IC<inf>50</inf> of 0.59 and 236 μg/ml. Only Pn extract inhibited AChE at IC<inf>50</inf> of 25.46 μg/ml. By GCMS and TLC fingerprints revealed the main constituents in LS, Ad, Al and Pn as apiol, cumialdehyde, furanodiene and piperine. Moreover, nine plant extracts and the whole recipe showed antioxidant activity. Conclusion: Lepidium sativum Linn. (Ls) extract showed the most potency on BuChE inhibitory effect. Three ingredients and the whole recipe exhibited mild activity. Only Piper nigrum L demonstrated inhibition effect on both AChE and BuChE. © 2015 Medical Association of Thailand.

This review highlights recent findings, describing the use of molecular approaches to monitor, diagnose, and predict alloimmune-mediated injury in kidney grafts. Recent findings Both previously identified and newly discovered molecular markers of immune injury have been studied and validated in large multicenter studies. Recent data indicate that measuring specific gene transcripts in noninvasive samples, such as urine or peripheral blood, can identify the occurrence of acute rejection and differentiate this immune-mediated injury from other causes of graft dysfunction. Serial monitoring of urine in stable renal transplant patients may detect the onset of rejection before development of graft dysfunction. Moreover, combining gene expression analysis with conventional histopathologic assessment of grafts can enhance the accuracy of diagnosis and may also help predict graft outcomes. Summary Measuring specific gene transcription in noninvasive clinical samples has the potential to become an important and standard tool to monitor alloimmune-mediated injury in kidney transplant recipients. Prospective studies are ongoing to validate these findings for use of these approaches in clinical settings. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health-Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Kidney transplantation; Microarray; microRNA; Molecular monitoring; mRNA,"microRNA; molecular marker; alloantibody; genetic marker; messenger RNA; microRNA; acute graft rejection; alloimmunity; blood sampling; diagnostic accuracy; gene expression; genetic transcription; histopathology; human; immune injury; kidney graft; kidney injury; kidney parenchyma; molecular biology; molecular diagnosis; molecular monitoring; patient monitoring; priority journal; renal graft dysfunction; Review; urinalysis; acute disease; adverse effects; genetic marker; genetics; graft rejection; immunological monitoring; immunology; kidney transplantation; predictive value; procedures; treatment outcome; Acute Disease; Genetic Markers; Graft Rejection; Humans; Isoantibodies; Kidney Transplantation; MicroRNAs; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Monitoring, Immunologic; Predictive Value of Tests; RNA, Messenger; Treatment Outcome",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927595587

In vitro analyses have indicated poor alloantigen-induced CD28- memory CD8 T cell proliferation, raising questions about mechanisms mediating their clonal expansion in kidney grafts to mediate injury. Candidate proliferative cytokines were tested for synergy with alloantigen in stimulating CD28- memory CD8 T cell proliferation. Addition of IL-15, but not IL-2 or IL-7, to co-cultures of CD28- or CD28+ memory CD8 T cells and allogeneic B cells rescued proliferation of the CD28- and enhanced CD28+ memory T cell proliferation. Proliferating CD28- memory CD8 T cells produced high amounts of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha and expressed higher levels of the cytolytic marker CD107a than CD28+ memory CD8 T cells. CTLA-4Ig inhibited alloantigen-induced proliferation of CD28+ memory CD8 T cell proliferation but had no effect on alloantigen plus IL-15-induced proliferation of either CD28- or CD28+ memory CD8 T cells. These results indicate the ability of IL-15, a cytokine produced by renal epithelial during inflammation, to provoke CD28- memory CD8 T cell proliferation and to confer memory CD8 T cell resistance to CTLA-4Ig-mediated costimulation blockade. IL-15 induces the activation of alloreactive CD28 - memory CD8 T cells and confers resistance of alloreactive CD28 + memory CD8 T cells to CTLA-4Ig-mediated inhibition. © Copyright 2014 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.",belatacept; Costimulation; cytokines/cytokine receptors; immunosuppressant; T cell biology,"abatacept; alloantigen; CD28 antigen; ctla 4ig; gamma interferon; interleukin 15; interleukin 2; interleukin 7; lysosome associated membrane protein 1; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; CD28 antigen; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; interleukin 15; adult; aged; article; B lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; human; human cell; in vitro study; kidney allograft; kidney graft; kidney graft rejection; lymphocyte proliferation; lymphocyte subpopulation; major histocompatibility complex; memory T lymphocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; protein expression; T lymphocyte activation; tissue injury; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cytology; immunological memory; immunology; lymphocyte activation; mixed lymphocyte culture; physiology; Antigens, CD28; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CTLA-4 Antigen; Humans; Immunologic Memory; Interleukin-15; Lymphocyte Activation; Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901356055

Extracted key information included patient clinical profiles and documented recurrence of cancer. The causes of death were verified from breast cancer case registration database, death certificates through The Ministry of Internal Affairs’ civil registration, by direct telephone contact, or by distributed prepaid postcards.Results: Medical records of 829 women diagnosed with breast cancer without prior evidence of distant metastasis, and had complete recommended treatment were included. Six hundred thirty seven women had not experienced any events up to the end of the follow-up (76.8%). The first occurring events were focused and categorized into three distinct types, locoregional recurrence (n = 83, median follow-up time = 34.2 months), distant recurrence (n = 78, median follow-up time = 35.4 months), and death without any evidences of locoregional or distant recurrences (n = 12, median follow-up time = 36.7 months). Distant recurrence after locoregional recurrence was reported (n = 33). There were109 patient who had died (breast cancer related death) up to the end of the follow-up (13.2%). The three types of consecutively occurring deaths were death after locoregional recurrence without any distant recurrences (n = 15), death after distant recurrence with locoregional recurrence (n = 21), and death after documented distant recurrence without any locoregional recurrences (n = 61).Conclusion: The trend was that the rate of the first occurring locoregional recurrence was slightly higher than that of distant recurrence. The death rate in patients without any recurrences was much lower than in those experiencing prior recurrences. The rates of disease progression from local recurrence to distant recurrence and to death were approximately 5 to 7 times faster in patients who had experienced earlier progressions. © 2014, Medical Association of Thailand.

The 1:1 molecular complexes of barakol and carboxylic acid (phthalic acid and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid) were prepared and the X-ray crystallographic studies revealed that the barakol-phthalate complex exists in an ion-pair complex. The formation of barakol-phthalate ion-pair complex is stabilized by the complementary of ion-ion interactions, π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding. The barakol-3-hydroxybenzoic acid complex is a π-π molecular complex. The co-crystallization of barakol-3- hydroxybenzoic acid complex is solely stabilized by π-π interactions. The spectroscopic studies including IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR are consistent with the results from the X-ray analysis.

Recently, two major findings clarified melatonin's mode of action. First, melatonin controls the production of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pars tuberalis of the adenohypophysis. This TSH regulates local thyroid hormone availability in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Second, the RF-amides kisspeptin and RFRP-3, recently discovered regulators of the gonadotropic axis, are involved in the melatonin control of reproduction. This study aims to establish a mechanistic link between the melatonin-driven TSH and the RF-amide control of reproduction. We treated short-day-adapted male Djungarian and Syrian hamsters with a chronic central infusion of TSH. In both hamster species, the central administration of 5 mIU/d TSH for 4 to 6 wk restored the summer phenotype of both testicular activity and kisspeptin and RFRP expression. Vehicle treated hamsters remain sexually inactive. Furthermore, the TSH treatment increased the body weight of lean short-day-adapted Djungarian hamsters and reduced hypothalamic somatostatin expression to the summer phenotype. In summary, our study demonstrates the pivotal role of melatonin-driven TSH for the seasonal regulation of reproduction and body weight, and uncovers the neuropeptides relaying this signal within the hypothalamus. © FASEB.",Body weight; Deiodinase 2; Melatonin; Reproduction; Seasonal rhythms; Somatostatin; Tancyte,"amide; arginylphenylalaninamide; kisspeptin; melatonin; neuropeptide; peptide derivative; RF amide related peptide 3; somatostatin; thyrotropin; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; article; body weight; controlled study; hypothalamus; male; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; reproduction; body weight; deiodinase 2; melatonin; reproduction; seasonal rhythms; somatostatin; tancyte; Animals; Body Weight; Cricetinae; Female; Gene Expression; Hypothalamus; Immunohistochemistry; In Situ Hybridization; Infusions, Intraventricular; Iodide Peroxidase; Kisspeptins; Male; Melatonin; Mesocricetus; Neuropeptides; Phodopus; Photoperiod; Receptors, Thyrotropin; Seasons; Somatostatin; Species Specificity; Testis; Thyrotropin; Time Factors; Cricetinae; Mammalia; Mesocricetus auratus",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879626426

In this work, we investigate a new promising improvement on a classification problem using multiple feature types. We assume that different features are suitable for different objects and the occurrence of particular objects usually relate to each other via particular relations. One possibility of finding such a special connection is to employ the advance of semantic technologies. Here, we investigate a new detection framework capable of detecting composite object instances. Unlike most of the previous works which attempts to detect an individual object as a whole, we aim at identifying its composition using an OWL ontology. To this end, low-level features obtained from an image are converted to ontological assertions, and the semantic reasoning of realization is employed to check the type of objects present in the image. © 2012 IEEE.",Classification; Object Recognition; Ontology; Semantic,Car side; Composite objects; Detection framework; Individual objects; Low-level features; Multiple features; Ontology-based; OWL ontologies; Semantic reasoning; Semantic technologies; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Information technology; Ontology; Semantics; Object recognition,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866749266

Methods: Two hikikomori case vignettes were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated the syndrome's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment. Results: Out of 247 responses to the questionnaire (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), 239 were enrolled in the analysis. Respondents' felt the hikikomori syndrome is seen in all countries examined and especially in urban areas. Biopsychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors were all listed as probable causes of hikikomori, and differences among countries were not significant. Japanese psychiatrists suggested treatment in outpatient wards and some did not think that psychiatric treatment is necessary. Psychiatrists in other countries opted for more active treatment such as hospitalization. Conclusions: Patients with the hikikomori syndrome are perceived as occurring across a variety of cultures by psychiatrists in multiple countries. Our results provide a rational basis for study of the existence and epidemiology of hikikomori in clinical or community populations in international settings. © Springer-Verlag 2011.",Amae; Hikikomori; Internet addiction; Social withdrawal; Taijin kyofusho,adult; article; human; international cooperation; Japan; mental disease; middle aged; obsessive compulsive disorder; pathophysiology; psychological aspect; questionnaire; social isolation; syndrome; Adult; Humans; Internationality; Japan; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; Questionnaires; Social Isolation; Syndrome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863776045

Although a sufficient MPA exposure is required, a high interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of MPA has been observed. The knowledge of MPA pharmacokinetics in lupus nephritis patients is limited, especially in Asian patients. This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for MPA and determine the population pharmacokinetic parameters and their interindividual variability in Thai patients with lupus nephritis. Methods: A total of 112 MPA plasma concentrations from 14 adult lupus nephritis patients (International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society Class III/IV) receiving mycophenolate mofetil were included in this study. The data was analyzed using NONMEM. The model evaluation was performed by the bootstrap approach and visual predictive check. Results: A two-compartment model with a lag time best described the data. The estimated mean apparent clearance (CL/F) was 14.5 l/h with an interindividual variability of 45.2%. The estimated mean CL/F was found to be lower than the values previously reported. The estimated mean apparent volume of the central compartment was 12.2 l with an interindividual variability of 166%. None of the covariates were found to significantly influence MPA pharmacokinetics. Conclusion: In this study, a population pharmacokinetic model of MPA in severe lupus nephritis patients was successfully developed. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated and a high interindividual variability of MPA in this population was observed. This provides evidence to show that individualizing dosage regimens in this population is crucial. The model developed in this study could be used to obtain initial information for MPA dose adjustments in Thai and Asian patients with lupus nephritis. Further studies are required to validate the results and clarify the influence of covariates on MMF pharmacokinetics. ©2012 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

Material and Method: The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of children hospitalized in four Thai tertiary care hospitals between June 1 and September 30, 2009, with reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction confirmed pH1N1. Household contact data were obtained by telephone. Results: Pediatric admissions numbered 115, 58 were females (50.4%). Median age was 5.2 (range 0.5 to 15) years. Fifty-one (44.4%) children had underlying diseases, most commonly asthma 17 (14.8%). Median preadmission illness duration was two days (range 1 to 10). Sixty-one (53.0%) children had lymphopenia. Chest X-ray infiltration was detected in 89 (77.4%) children. Oseltamivir was prescribed in 104 (90.4%) children; 47 (45.2%) within 48 hours of illness. 70 (60.9%) children received antibiotics. The median hospitalization was three days (range 1 to 94). Independent (multivariate analysis) factors associated with prolonged hospitalization (≥ 7 days) were aged five to nine years (OR 7.4; 95% CI 1.1-48.9, p = 0.037) and having an underlying disease (OR 5.9; 95% CI 1.5-23.3, p = 0.01). Five (4.3%) children required mechanical ventilation; two (1.7%) children died. Household data showed that 63 of 109 (57.8%) patients had contact with a suspected or confirmed pH1N1 case. There were 39 (15.7%) of 249 household contacts who were probable secondary cases: 23 suspected and 16 confirmed pH1N1 of whom 25 (64.1%) were aged ≤ 18 years. Conclusion: Most pH1N1 infected hospitalized children had pneumonia, an uneventful short hospitalization, and a low in hospital mortality. Half of the patients were household acquired.

Four groups were prepared having axial wall heights of 4 mm around the preparation circumferences. In 3 of the groups with axial tooth structure, mesial axial tooth structure was removed, mesial and lingual axial tooth structure were removed, mesial-lingual and distal axial tooth structure were removed. For the fifth group, all axial tooth structure was removed to the level of the prepared finish line. All 50 prepared teeth were restored with fiber-reinforced composite posts (FRC Postec Plus) and composite resin cores (Multicore Flow). Testing was conducted with a universal testing machine with the application of a static load to the lingual incline plane of buccal cusp at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min at 45 degrees to the long axis of the tooth.

Methods: RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with or without E. foetidum extract for 1 h prior to incubation with LPS for 24 h. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated with reference to iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α and IL-6 geneexpression. In addition, NO and intracellular ROS generation were determined by Griess method and fluorescence intensityand activation of MAPKs and IkB by Western blotting. Results: Prior treatment with E. foetidum leaf extract inhibited elevation of IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS and COX-2, together with their cognate mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner. NO and intracellular ROS contents were similarly reduced. These effects were due to inhibition of LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK and p38 as well as IκB.

We explored whether MTD is frequently seen in Japan and also in other countries, and if so, how patients with MTD are diagnosed and treated. Methods: The questionnaires, with two case vignettes (traditional type depression (TTD) and MTD), were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated their opinions about each case's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment using Likert scales. Results: Out of 247 responses (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), two hundred thirty-nine valid responses were received. MTD was recognized in all participating countries, and especially in urban areas. Generally, the factor of personality was regarded as the most probable cause of MTD. Whereas about 90% of Japanese psychiatrists applied the ICD/DSM criteria to TTD, only about 60% applied the criteria to MTD. Conclusion: Our results indicate that Japan's MTD seems to be occurring in many other countries, and that the present ICD/DSM criteria may not be sufficient to diagnose MTD. Therefore, it could be an important candidate for a new international diagnostic criterion as a subtype of depression. A clear diagnostic framework and consensus on the interventions to treat MTD would be valuable. Further clinical, psychopathological and international epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings of MTD. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Because cellular activation during inflammation leads to the release of arachidonate, a stimulator of leukocyte function, we sought to determine whether arachidonate regulates CRIg expression. Adding arachidonate to maturing human macrophages and to prematured CRIg + macrophages caused a significant decrease in the expression of cell-surface CRIg and CRIg mRNA. This effect was independent of the metabolism of arachidonate via the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, because it was not inhibited by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Studies with specific pharmacological inhibitors of arachidonate-mediated signaling pathways showed that protein kinase C was involved. Administration of dexamethasone to macrophages caused an increase in CRIg expression. Studies with proinflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines showed that IL-10 increased, but interferon-γ, IL-4, and transforming growth factor-β1 decreased CRIg expression on macrophages. This down- and up-regulation of CRIg expression was reflected in a decrease and increase, respectively, in the phagocytosis of complement opsonized Candida albicans. These data suggest that a unique inflammatory mediator network regulates CRIg expression and point to a mechanism by which arachidonate and dexamethasone have reciprocal effects on inflammation. © 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.",,"arachidonic acid; autacoid; complement receptor; complement receptor immunoglobulin; cytokine; dexamethasone; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin; indometacin; interleukin 10; interleukin 4; lipoxygenase; messenger RNA; nordihydroguaiaretic acid; prostaglandin synthase; protein kinase C; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; article; Candida albicans; cell maturation; cell surface; controlled study; cytokine production; down regulation; fatty acid metabolism; human; human cell; macrophage; opsonization; phagocytosis; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; upregulation; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Arachidonic Acid; Candida albicans; Cells, Cultured; Cytokines; Dexamethasone; Down-Regulation; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Lipoxygenase; Macrophages; Phagocytosis; Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases; Receptors, Complement 3b; RNA, Messenger",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052868421

In this application, the multi-objective bees algorithm (MOBA) is developed for solving the multi-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problems on small and large scale power system. The objectives of MOOPF are to minimize the total fuel cost of generation, environmental pollution and power system loss by considering many constraints i.e. limits on generator real and reactive power outputs, bus voltages, transformer tap-setting and power flow of transmission lines. Proposed crowded selection mechanism and fuzzy mechanism techniques are added into selection process of proposed MOBA. Also, the algorithm based on fuzzy set theory is used to extract the best compromise solution. In order to prove the proposed MOBA method, the simulation result of weight aggregation is used for comparison. The standard IEEE-30 and IEEE-118 bus system is selected to test the algorithm. The result shows that Pareto front of proposed MOBA are diverse and well distributed. The proposed MOBA have good performance and efficiency to solve multi-objective optimal power flow. © 2011 IEEE.",Bees Algorithm; Multi-objective Bee Algorithm; Multi-objective Optimal Power Flow,Bees algorithms; Bus systems; Bus voltage; Compromise solutions; Environmental pollutions; Fuel cost; Large-scale power systems; Multi objective; Multi-objective optimal power flow; New applications; Pareto front; Power flows; Real and reactive power; Selection mechanism; Selection process; Simulation result; Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Information technology; Multiobjective optimization; Power transmission; Reactive power; Telecommunication; Algorithms,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961216740

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were isolated from healthy volunteers. Cells, at a concentration of 110 6 cell/ml, were induced to secrete TNF-by exposure to 10 ng/ml LPS in the presence and absence of the ethyl acetate extract of Aquilaria crassna. The TNF-a secretion in the collection medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the TNF-gene expression was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Determination of ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK activation were performed by Western blot analysis using a specific phosphorylated form of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK antibody. LPS at a concentration of 10 ng/ml significantly increased in TNF-a secretion and was significantly inhibited when treated with 1.5 mg/ml ethyl acetate extract of Aquilaria crassna (P&lt; 0.05). Moreover, on treatment with 1.5 mg/ml, the extracts showed TNF-gene expression inhibition. Co-treatment of the extract with LPS could not block p38 MAPK activation, but pre-treatment of the extracts significantly reduced the p38 MAPK phosphorylation without affecting the ERK1/2 MAPK activation (P&lt; 0.05).

The present study aimed to investigate cytotoxic activities of crude ethanol extracts of a total of 28 plants and 5 recipes used in Thai folklore medicine against human cholangiocarcinoma (CL-6), human laryngeal (Hep-2), and human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cell lines in vitro.Methods: Cytotoxic activity of the plant extracts against the cancerous cell lines compared with normal cell line (renal epithelial cell: HRE) were assessed using MTT assay. 5-fluorouracil was used as a positive control. The IC50(concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50%) and the selectivity index (SI) were calculated.Results: The extracts from seven plant species (Atractylodes lancea, Kaempferia galangal, Zingiber officinal, Piper chaba, Mesua ferrea, Ligusticum sinense, Mimusops elengi) and one folklore recipe (Pra-Sa-Prao-Yhai) exhibited promising activity against the cholangiocarcinoma CL-6 cell line with survival of less than 50% at the concentration of 50 μg/ml. Among these, the extracts from the five plants and one recipe (Atractylodes lancea, Kaempferia galangal, Zingiber officinal, Piper chaba, Mesua ferrea, and Pra-Sa-Prao-Yhai recipe) showed potent cytotoxic activity with mean IC50values of 24.09, 37.36, 34.26, 40.74, 48.23 and 44.12 μg/ml, respectively. All possessed high activity against Hep-2 cell with mean IC50ranging from 18.93 to 32.40 μg/ml. In contrast, activity against the hepatoma cell HepG2 varied markedly; mean IC50ranged from 9.67 to 115.47 μg/ml. The only promising extract was from Zingiber officinal (IC50= 9.67 μg/ml). The sensitivity of all the four cells to 5-FU also varied according to cell types, particularly with CL-6 cell (IC50= 757 micromolar). The extract from Atractylodes lancea appears to be both the most potent and most selective against cholangiocarcinoma (IC50= 24.09 μg/ml, SI = 8.6).Conclusions: The ethanolic extracts from five plants and one folklore recipe showed potent cytotoxic activity against CL-6 cell. Sensitivity to other cancerous cell lines varied according to cell types and the hepatocarcinoma cell line. HepG2 appears to be the most resistant to the tested extracts. © 2010 Mahavorasirikul et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Amomum testaceum extract; analgesic agent; Anethum graveolens extract; Angelica dahurica extract; Angelica sinensis extract; Artemisia annua extract; Asclepias curassavica extract; Atractylodes extract; cuminum cyminum extract; cytotoxic agent; Dioscorea membranacea extract; Dracaena loureiri gagnep extract; fluorouracil; Foeniculum vulgare extract; ginger extract; Kaempferia galangal extract; Ligusticum sinense extract; Mammea siamensis extract; Mesua ferrea extract; mimusops elengi extract; myristica fragrans extract; Nigella sativa extract; Piper chaba extract; Piper interruptum extract; Piper sarmentosum extract; plant extract; Plumbago indica extract; Smilax corbularia extract; syzygium aromaticum extract; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antineoplastic agent; plant extract; angelica dahurica; Angelica sinensis; antineoplastic activity; article; Asclepias curassavica; asthma; Atractylodes lancea; bacterial infection; bile duct carcinoma; black cumin; bladder disease; bronchitis; cancer cell; cancer cell culture; cell viability; choking; clove; common cold; coughing; cumin; cytotoxicity; diarrhea; dill; Dioscorea membranacea; Dracaena loureiri gagnep; drug synthesis; dyspepsia; eye pain; fever; headache; hemorrhoid; human; human cell; human cell culture; hypercholesterolemia; hypertriglyceridemia; IC 50; in vitro study; inflammation; influenza; jaundice; Kaempferia galangal; larynx carcinoma; Ligusticum sinense; liver cell carcinoma; Mammea siamensis kosterm; medicinal plant; Mesua ferrea; Mimusops elengi; neoplasm; neurodermatitis; nutmeg; pain; Piper chaba; Piper interruptum; Piper sarmentosum; pleurisy; Plumbago indica; rheumatic disease; Smilax corbularia; sore throat; syncope; Thailand; tooth pain; treatment indication; uterus pain; angiosperm; Atractylodes; bile duct carcinoma; cell strain HepG2; cytology; drug effect; drug screening; epithelium cell; kidney; larynx tumor; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; medicinal plant; oriental medicine; phytotherapy; Thailand; tumor cell line; Angiosperms; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Atractylodes; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line, Tumor; Cholangiocarcinoma; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Epithelial Cells; Fluorouracil; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Kidney; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Liver Neoplasms; Medicine, East Asian Traditional; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Thailand",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957139136

Here we tested whether pharmacokinetic monitoring may help to optimize dosing of MPA in an Asian population. Patients with biopsy-proven class III or IV lupus nephritis (ISN/RPS category) were treated with mycophenolate mofetil or enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium. One month after initiating treatment we measured plasma MPA levels in eight samples taken over a 12-h period after drug administration. The mean area under the time-dependent curve for MPA of responding patients was significantly higher than those not responding. Successful treatment was seen in patients with areas >45 mg h/l. The dosage of the drug was not related to MPA pharmacokinetics. In the mycophenolate mofetil group, however, MPA-area under the curve was positively, and significantly, correlated with trough or 1 h after dose concentrations and associated with a therapeutic response. Thus, our study shows that MPA pharmacokinetics were positively correlated with therapeutic responses of mycophenolate, suggesting that controlling the concentrations may improve its therapeutic efficacy in lupus nephritis. As the absorption and pharmacokinetic peak of enteric-coated tablets is slower, it is important to take different formulations into account when determining optimal MPA concentrations. © 2010 International Society of Nephrology.",glomerulonephritis; immunosuppression; lupus nephritis; mycophenolate mofetil; pharmacokinetics,"mycophenolic acid; adult; area under the curve; article; biopsy; blood toxicity; clinical article; controlled study; drug absorption; drug efficacy; enteric coated tablet; female; gastrointestinal symptom; human; infection; lupus erythematosus nephritis; male; priority journal; treatment response; Absorption; Adult; Area Under Curve; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Drug Monitoring; Female; Humans; Lupus Nephritis; Male; Mycophenolic Acid; Pharmacokinetics; Tablets, Enteric-Coated",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955174768

Reference strains including C. jejuni ATCC 33291, C. coli MUMT 18407, C. lari ATCC 43675, and C. upsaliensis DMST 19055 were used. The initial numbers of artificially-inoculated viable cells per g of chicken meat were approximately 10 to 104. Constituents of mucin plus bile (1:1), varieties of amino acids, and sodium salts were added into a soft-agar-coated membrane filter and incubated at both 37°C and 42°C for 24h. The drop plate method was used to determine numbers of viable Campylobacter at 6, 12, 18, and 24h. After 6h, constituents of mucin plus bile at the concentrations of 1, 5, and 10% demonstrated significant increases in numbers of viable cells (p&lt;0.05). The numbers of the organisms at 42°C were higher than those at 37°C. In contrast, no significant difference in cell numbers was observed by adding amino acids or sodium salts. In addition, the role of starvation on chemotactic responses was also studied. Starved cells showed lower chemotactic response than non-starved cells.

In a case series of seven Thai patients and 17 patients identified in the literature, clinical and microbiological cure rates with IT/IVT colistin therapy were 83% and 92%, respectively. Three patients (13%) developed chemical ventriculitis and one (4%) experienced treatment-associated seizures.

Published sequences of PCR primers for C. perfringens alpha toxin gene were used and PCR conditions were optimized. From the detection of C. perfringens by FDT tube to the confirmation by a colony PCR assay took as short as 16-18 h. The method was applied to 147 isolates of anaerobic sulfite reducing bacteria isolated from foods, sewages and animal clinical specimens. The results were compared with standard methods for the confirmation of C. perfringens. Of those 147 suspected isolates, 97 and 99 were confirmed as C. perfringens by standard methods and the colony PCR technique, respectively. We found the developed method simple, rapid, cost-effective, and most importantly, very reliable for the detection and confirmation of C. perfringens. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS With Fung's double tube method and a colony polymerase chain reaction technique, a completed determination of Clostridium perfringens contamination can be accomplished within 16-18 h. This saves at least 2-3 days when compared with standard methods. Moreover, it minimizes the cost and labor needed since an anaerobic chamber as well as steps of Gram staining and biochemical testing can be avoided. The developed method is a powerful tool and an alternative for the enumeration of C. perfringens. It can be applied to samples from various sources and highly reliable results are expected. Most microbiological laboratories have a thermocycler and reagents as parts of their basic instruments.

Here we sought to correlate intrarenal VEGF expression with renal histopathology and prognosis of LN. Biopsyd specimens from 35 patients with Class III or IV LN (ISN/RPS categorization) were found to have lower levels of intrarenal VEGF than those found in biopsy tissue taken from 10 donor kidneys sampled at the time of allograft reperfusion. This reduced amount of VEGF mRNA in the patients with LN negatively correlated with glomerular endocapillary proliferation, crescent formation, and a high histologic activity index but was positively associated with increased numbers of urinary podocytes. The level of intrarenal VEGF mRNA accurately predicted the deterioration of renal function in these patients within 12 months. Our study shows that expression of VEGF in renal tissue may serve as a molecular marker of renal damage and may be a predictive factor for short-term loss of kidney function in patients with LN. © 2009 International Society of Nephrology.",Biomarker; Lupus nephritis; Molecular diagnosis; Podocyte; VEGF; WT-1,"angiopoietin 1; heme oxygenase 1; messenger RNA; transforming growth factor beta; vasculotropin; adult; article; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; kidney biopsy; kidney function; lupus erythematosus nephritis; male; podocyte; priority journal; prognosis; protein expression; protein localization; Adult; Angiopoietin-1; Biological Markers; Case-Control Studies; Female; Gene Expression; Heme Oxygenase-1; Humans; Kidney; Lupus Nephritis; Male; Podocytes; Prognosis; RNA, Messenger; Time Factors; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Urine; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349118094

Clinical spectrum, natural history, prognosis, and pathogenesis of MFS are not fully documented. Objective: Probe the clinical features of MFS in a tertiary center in Thailand and compare its pattern with other Asian countries. Material and Method: The clinical recordings were searched from databases at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) between 2002 and 2007. Keywords were ""Miller-Fisher syndrome"" and ""Guillain-Barré syndrome"". Cases with MFS were recruited. The data regarding clinical features, course, treatments, and investigations were reviewed. Comparisons with other large Asian series were demonstrated. Results: Six patients (male: female; 3:3) with MFS were analyzed. The incident rate is 7.7% that of GBS. The median age was 54.3 years (range 28 to 73 years). MFS frequently started with diplopia followed by ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. Other clinical symptoms included limb dysesthesia and weakness, dysphagia, dysarthria, and diffuse headache. Spontaneous recovery occurred in three patients while two patients received plasmapheresis and one received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Six months after neurological deficits, all patients were almost free of symptoms and had returned to their normal activities. Conclusion: The incidence, clinical features, and prognosis of MFS in KCMH were comparable with the previous studies in other Asian countries. High percentage of limb dysesthesia and optic neuropathy were detected in the present series. Headache was also common among Thai MFS.

To characterize healthcare-associated infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae that harbor multiple ESBL genes, as opposed to a single ESBL gene. METHODS. All patients with a confirmed healthcare-associated infection due to an ESBL-producing strain of E. coli or K. pneumoniae were enrolled in the study. Molecular typing of isolates was performed, and the comparative risks and outcomes of patients were analyzed. RESULTS. Among 71 patients with healthcare-associated infection due to an ESBL-producing strain of E. coli or K. pneumoniae, the gene for CTX-M, with or without other ESBL genes, was identified in all 51 (100%) of the patients infected with an E. coli strain and in 18 (90%) of the 20 patients infected with a K. pneumoniae strain. Of these 71 patients, 17 (24%) met the definition of healthcare-associated infection due to an ESBL-producing strain that harbored multiple genes; in multivariate analysis, previous exposure to 3 or more classes of antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.7-75.2]) was the sole risk factor for healthcare-associated infection due to an ESBL-producing strain that harbored multiple ESBL genes. Isolates recovered from patients with healthcare-associated infection due to an ESBL-producing strain that harbored multiple ESBL genes were more resistant to various antibiotic classes, and, compared with patients with healthcare-associated infection due to an ESBL-producing strain that harbored a single ESBL gene, they were more likely to have ineffective initial empirical antimicrobial therapy (52% vs 94%; odds ratio, 5.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.04-14.5]). CONCLUSIONS. CTX-M ESBL is highly prevalent in Thailand. Patients with healthcare-associated infection due to an ESBL-producing strain that harbored multiple ESBL genes were more likely to have had ineffective initial empirical antimicrobial therapy, and, given that antibiotic selection pressure was the only associated risk, we suggest focused antimicrobial stewardship programs to limit the emergence and spread of healthcare-associated infection due to ESBL-producing strains in this middle-income country. © 2008 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

In the present study, we have found that, in the Golgi and cap phases, round spermatid nuclei contain 10-nm to 30-nm chromatin fibers, and that the acrosomal granule forms a huge cap over the anterior pole of nucleus. In the acrosomal phase, many chromatin fibers are ̃50 nm thick; these then thickened to 70-nm fibers and eventually became 90-nm chromatin cords that are tightly packed together into highly condensed chromatin, except where nuclear vacuoles occur. Immunocytochemistry and immunogold localization with anti-histones, anti-transition protein2, and anti-protamine antibodies suggest that histones remain throughout spermiogenesis, that transition proteins are present from step 7 spermatids and remain until the end of spermiogenesis, and that protamines appear at step 8. Spermatozoa from the cauda epididymidis have been analyzed by acid urea Triton X-100 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for basic nuclear proteins. The histones, H2A, H3, H2B, and H4, transitional protein2, and protamine are all present in sperm extracts.

The isolate showed typical Leptospira motility and morphology under dark-field microscopy. Cells were 10-13 μm long and 0.2 μm in diameter, with a wavelength of 0.5 μm and an amplitude of approximately 0.3 μm. Phenotypically, strain Khorat-H2T did not grow at 13 °C but grew at 30 and 37 °C and in the presence of 8-azaguanine. Serological identification using the microscopic agglutination test revealed that strain Khorat-H2T had no cross-reaction with any recognized Leptospira serogroups. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed the novel strain within the radiation of the genus Leptospira, with sequence similarities of 88.1-97.7% to recognized Leptospira species. DNA-DNA hybridization against the type strains of the three most closely related Leptospira species was used to confirm the results of the 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The G+C content of strain Khorat-H2T was 41.8 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, serological and phylogenetic data, strain Khorat-H2T represents a novel species of the genus Leptospira, for which the name Leptospira wolffii sp. nov. is proposed.

We conducted molecular detection and characterization of ESBL-related bla genes, including blaTEM, butSHV, blaCTX-M, blaVEB, blaOXA, blaPER, and blaGES, among 362 isolates of ESBL-producing E. coli (n = 235) and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (n = 127) collected from patients who met the definition of HA infection at two major university hospitals in Thailand from December 2004 to May 2005. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, patient demographics and the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were described. A total of 87.3% of isolates carried several bla genes. The prevalence of blaCTX-M was strikingly high: 99.6% for ESBL-producing E. coli (CTX-M-14, -15, -27, -40, and -55) and 99.2% for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (CTX-M-3, -14, -15, -27, and -55). ISEcp1 was found in the upstream region of blaCTX-M in most isolates. Up to 77.0% and 71.7% of ESBL-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, respectively, carried blaTEM; all of them encoded TEM-1. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae carried blaSHV at 87.4% (SHV-1, -2a, -11, -12, -27, -71, and -75) but only at 3.8% for ESBL-producing E. coli (SHV-11 and -12). bla genes encoding VEB-1 and OXA-10 were found in both ESBL-producing E. coli (8.5% and 8.1%, respectively) and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (10.2% and 11.8%, respectively). None of the isolates were positive for blaPER and blaGES. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that there was no major clonal relationship among these ESBL producers. This is the first study to report CTX-M-3, CTX-M-27, CTX-M-40, SHV-27, SHV-71, and SHV-75 in Thailand and to show that CTX-M ESBL is highly endemic in the country.

The first phase of national surveillance for avian influenza (H5N1) human disease in Thailand occurred over a 4-month period that began on 1 December 2003. Subsequently, a nationally coordinated laboratory system (NCLS) for avian influenza (H5N1) was created to assess population-based surveillance, specimen procurement, case detection, and reporting at the national level. Methods. We conducted a pre- and postintervention study to evaluate the NCLS designed during the 6-week interval from 1 April through 15 May 2004. During the pre-NCLS period (1 December 2003 through 31 March 2004), 12 cases of human avian influenza (H5N1) were confirmed. During the post-NCLS period (16 May 2004 through 31 December 2006), interventions were implemented for human avian influenza (H5N1) surveillance, case detection, and expedited, computer-based reporting. Results. During the pre- and post-NCLS periods, 777 (85%) of 915 and 10,434 (95%) of 11,042 clinical respiratory specimens, respectively, were adequate for confirmatory testing (P < .001), the median time from procurement to results decreased from 17 days (range, 14-24 days) to 1.8 days (range, 0.25-4 days; P < .001), and the duration of specimen shipment decreased from 46.5 h to 21.1 h (P < .001). Thirteen cases of avian influenza (H5N1) were detected during the 31-month postintervention period. H5N1 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 99.8%. Conclusions. The NCLS exemplifies a systematic approach to national surveillance for avian influenza A (H5N1). This NCLS program in Thailand serves as a model for human avian influenza (H5N1) preparedness that can be adopted or modified for use in other countries. © 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

We prospectively followed 72 patients, consecutively admitted to a Thai regional hospital with FUO and HIV infection to identify aetiologies and mortality in the era of available antiretroviral therapy (ART). Aetiologies of FUO were identified in 67 patients (93%), of whom 61(85%) had an infectious aetiology. The most common infectious aetiologies were Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 30; 42%), Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 17; 24%), Pneumocystis jiroveci (n = 9; 13%), Toxoplasma gondii (n = 5; 7%), and salmonella bacteraemia (n = 5; 7%).

Methods: This study is an incidence-based cost-of-illness analysis from a provider's perspective. The sample cases in this study were shigellosis patients residing in Kaengkhoi District, Saraburi Province, Thailand. All diarrhea patients who came to the health-care centers in Kaengkhoi District, Kaengkhoi District Hospital and Saraburi Regional Hospital during the period covering May 2002 to April 2003 were tested for Shigella spp. The sample for our study included all patients with culture that confirmed the presence of shigellosis. Public treatment cost was defined as the costs incurred by the health-care service facilities arising from individual cases. The cost was calculated based on the number of services that were utilized (clinic visits, hospitalization, pharmaceuticals, and laboratory investigations), as well as the unit cost of the services (material, labor and capital costs). The data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Furthermore, the stepwise multiple regressions were employed to create a cost function, and the uncertainty was tested by a one-way sensitivity analysis of varying discount rate, cost category, and drug prices. Results: Cost estimates were based from 137 episodes of 130 patients. Ninety-four percent of them received treatment as outpatients. One-fifth of the episodes were children aged less than 5 years old. The average public treatment cost was US$8.65 per episode based on 2006 prices (95% CI, 4.79, and 12.51) (approximately US$1 = 38.084 Thai baht). The majority of the treatment cost (59.3%) was consumed by the hospitalized patients, though they only accounted for 5.8% of all episodes. The sensitivity analysis on the component of costs and drug prices showed a variation in the public treatment cost ranging from US$8.29 to US$9.38 (-4.20% and 8.43% of the base-case, respectively). The public treatment cost model has an adjusted R 2 of 0.788. The positive predictor variables were types of services (inpatient and outpatient), types of health-care facilities (health center, district hospital, regional hospital), and insurance schemes (civil servants medical benefit scheme, social security scheme and universal health coverage scheme). Treatment cost was estimated for various scenarios based on the fitted cost model. Conclusion: The average public treatment cost of shigellosis in Thailand was estimated in this study. Service types, health-care facilities, and insurance schemes were the predictors used to predict nearly 80% of the cost. The estimated cost based on the fitted model can be employed for hospital management and health-care planning. © 2008, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).",Cost function; Public treatment cost; Shigellosis,"adult; bacterium culture; conference paper; cost of illness; diarrhea; female; health care cost; health care facility; health care planning; health insurance; hospital management; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; outpatient; preschool child; priority journal; Shigella; shigellosis; social security; Thailand; Anti-Infective Agents; Drug Costs; Dysentery, Bacillary; Female; Health Care Costs; Hospital Costs; Humans; Incidence; Male; Models, Economic; Regression Analysis; Thailand",Conference Paper,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-41749104890

FNA of the left parotid mass was performed, and findings suggestive of malignancy were discovered. A wide local excision was performed 1 year later, and MLEL with metastasis to the regional lymph nodes was diagnosed by histopathology. Conclusion: We report our first experience of cytologic findings from FNA of histologically diagnosed MLEL. The aspirate comprised groups of cohesive and isolated malignant epithelials with a background of numerous lymphocytes.

In ISISP, portfolio derived from CRUD matrix will union with portfolio derived from SWOT/strategic themes which results in three sets of applications, namely the existing non-core applications, the core applications and the future applications. Then application transformation is applied to both core and non core application groups. For the future application group, each application will be mapped onto the existing CRUD matrix resulting in a new CRUD matrix, called ICRUD, which represents the information architecture that bridges the existing applications to the future strategically derived mission critical applications. The ISISP methodology therefore facilitates the actual implementations since all application boundaries will be derivable for the ICRUD matrix. Also, the business areas will be focused and realistic.

Simultaneous interruption of all drugs exposes the patients to NNRTI monotherapy. This study evaluated HIV-1 genotype after treatment interruption (TI) of NNRTI-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and virological response after resumption of the same ART regimen. A prospective study was conducted in HIV-1-infected patients who enrolled into a CD4-guided TI study. All patients continued dual NRTIs for a further 7-10 days at NNRTI TI. HIV-1 genotypic assay was performed prior to resumption of the same ART regimen. Forty-three patients required ART resumption after TI from NNRTI-based regimens. Mean age was 42.7 years; 44% were men. Median CD4 and HIV-1 RNA at the time of ART resumption were 178 cell/mm 3 and 5.78 log copies/mL, respectively. HIV-1 genotype revealed no mutations contributed to NRTI or NNRTI resistance. Of all, 56% and 100% patients achieved undetectable HIV-1 RNA at three and six months, respectively. Median CD4 were 386 and 419 cells/mm3 at the corresponding periods. In conclusion, continuation of dual NRTIs for 7-10 days after TI of NNRTI-based regimens can minimize the risk of acquired NNRTI resistance.

The integrated SOFC system consists of a distillation column, an EtOH/H2O heater, an air heater, an anode preheater, a reformer, an SOFC stack and an afterburner. Bioethanol with 5 mol% ethanol was purified in a distillation column to obtain a desired concentration necessary for SOFC operation. The SOFC stack was operated under isothermal conditions. The heat generated from the stack and the afterburner was supplied to the reformer and three heaters. The net remaining heat from the SOFC system (QSOFC,Net) was then provided to the reboiler of the distillation column. The effects of fuel utilization and operating voltage on the net energy (QNet), which equals QSOFC,Net minus the distillation energy (QD), were examined. It was found that the system could become more energy sufficient when operating at lower fuel utilization or lower voltage but at the expense of less electricity produced. Moreover, it was found that there were some operating conditions, which yielded QNet of zero. At this point, the integrated system provides the maximum electrical power without requiring an additional heat source. The effects of ethanol concentration and ethanol recovery on the electrical performance at zero QNet for different fuel utilizations were investigated. With the appropriate operating conditions (e.g. CEtOH = 41%, Uf = 80% and EtOH recovery = 80%), the overall electrical efficiency and power density are 33.3% (LHV) and 0.32 W cm-2, respectively. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Lipodystrophy is common and options for switching ART regimen are limited; this situation can lead to patients' poor adherence and antiretroviral resistance. Treatment interruption (TI) in patients with high CD4 cell counts, lipodystrophy, and limited options may be an alternative in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to determine time to resume ART after TI and predictors for early resumption of ART in a resource-limited setting. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in January 2005 to December 2006 and enrolled HIV-infected patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL, CD4 &gt; 350 cells/mm3, and willing to interrupt ART. CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA, lipid profile, and lipodystrophy were assessed at baseline and every 3 months. ART was resumed when CD4 declined to &lt;250 cells/ mm3 or developed HIV-related symptoms. Patients were grouped based on ART regimens [NNRTI or protease inhibitor (PI)] prior to TI. Results: There were 99 patients, 85 in NNRTI group and 14 in PI group. Mean age was 40.6 years; 46% were males. Median duration of ART was 47 months. Median nadir CD4 and baseline CD4 were 151 and 535 cells/mm3, respectively. Median CD4 change at 3 months after TI were -259 (NNRTI) and -105 (PI) cells/mm3 (p = 0.038). At 13-month median follow-up, there was no AIDS-defining illness; 38% (NNRTI) and 29% (PI) of patients developed HIV-related symptoms. ART was resumed in 51% (NNRTI) and 36% (PI) of patients (p = 0.022). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, median time to resume ART was 5.5 (NNRTI) and 14.2 (PI) months (log rank test, p = 0.026). By Cox's regression analysis, NNRTI-based ART (HR 4.9; 95%CI, 1.5-16.3), nadir CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 (HR 2.7; 95%CI 1.4-5.3) and baseline CD4 &lt;500 cells/mm3 (HR 1.6; 95%CI, 1.2-3.1) were predictors for early ART resumption. Conclusion: TI of NNRTI-based ART leads to rapid CD4 decline and high probability of early ART resumption and should be avoided. It is necessary to scale-up the options for HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy in resource-limited settings. © 2007 Sungkanuparph et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,didanosine; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lamivudine; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; proteinase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; stavudine; triacylglycerol; virus RNA; zidovudine; adult; article; CD4 lymphocyte count; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; female; follow up; HIV associated lipodystrophy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prospective study; triacylglycerol blood level,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38549123960

In developing countries, health care worker preparedness training should address the modes of avian influenza transmission and specify how to implement appropriate infection-control strategies to prevent and control the spread of avian influenza. We provide evidence for avian influenza transmission methods and identify prevention strategies relevant to infection control for hospitals in developing countries. Pandemic influenza preparedness plans must include health care administrative support, mechanisms to rapidly create temporary isolation facilities, systems to restrict access to exposed health care workers, and plans to involve specialists to screen and identify cases early, to provide for continuous monitoring to ensure adherence to optimal infection-control practices, and to provide regular feedback to health care workers. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Setting: A 450-bed, tertiary-care hospital. Patients: All patients admitted to the hospital from September 1, 2003 to June 12, 2004 with urinary catheter (UC). An independent observer reviewed the patient's chart, interviewed the patient and nursing staff, and assessed the need for the UC daily until the catheter was removed or the patient was discharged. Results: One hundred thirty-one (15%) of 895 patients had initiation of IUC. The median age was 61 (range, 15-92). Medicine (0.52 catheter utilization ratio), surgery (0.24 catheter utilization ratio) and the ICUs (0.32) had the most UC use. Main reasons for initial IUC included no clear indication (28%), inappropriate urine output monitoring (26%), and urinary incontinence (18%). Admission to the medical ICU (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.3; P < 0.001), nonambulatory functional status (aOR = 2.1; P < 0.001), and female sex (aOR = 1.9; P = 0.001) were independently associated with IUC. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CA-UTI) occurred in 129 patients (14%). Patients with IUC had a longer duration of catheterization (12 vs. 3 days; P < 0.01) were more likely to develop CA-UTI (82% vs. 8%; P = 0.001) and had prolonged hospital length of stay (median, 15 vs. 5 days; P<0.001). The mean monthly cost of antibiotics for treatment of CA-UTI was $3480 (range, $1874-$5584). Conclusion: UC were inappropriately used more commonly among female, nonambulatory, and medical ICU patients.

Methods: Our objective was to evaluate the clinical and molecular epidemiology of community-onset, extended-spectrum β-lactamase (CO-ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli infections. We used a case-case-control study undertaken in a 450-bed, tertiary care hospital. Patients included case group (CG) I, which had confirmed CO-ESBL-producing E coli infections (n = 46). Case group (CG) II (n = 46) included patients with CO-non-ESBL-producing E coli infections. Controls (n = 138) were patients without infections. Results: By multivariate analysis, diabetes (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-13.2, P < .001), prior ESBL E coli colonization (<90 days) (95% CI: 1.2-67.8, P < .001), recent receipt of antibiotics (<90 days) (95% CI: 4.2-44.2, P = .004), and previous exposure to third-generation cephalosporins (95% CI: 2.2-16.4, P = .001) and fluoroquinolones (95% CI: 1.4-18.3; P = .003) were associated risks among CG I. Diabetes (95% CI: 1.6-15.4, P = .005), stroke (95% CI: 1.5-17.1, P = .001), and diarrhea (95% CI: 3.8-65.8, P = .001) were risks among CG II. Patients with CO-ESBL in CG I versus controls were more likely to die (30% vs 0%, respectively; P < .001), had prolonged hospital length of stay (8 vs 5 days, respectively; P < .001), and had higher hospitalization costs (median, US $528 vs $108, respectively; P < .001). The plasmid carrying the CTX-M-15 gene was identified in 13 of 25 (52%) available CO-ESBL-producing E coli isolates. Conclusion: CO-ESBL-producing E coli is an emerging multidrug-resistant microorganism in Thailand. Patients with prior ESBL colonization and recent antibiotic exposures, especially to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, were at risk for CO-ESBL-producing E coli infection. © 2007 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.",,"aminoglycoside; antibiotic agent; cefotaxime; cefpirome; ceftazidime; ceftriaxone; cephalosporin derivative; cotrimoxazole; ertapenem; extended spectrum beta lactamase; imipenem; macrolide; meropenem; penicillin G; piperacillin plus tazobactam; quinolone derivative; adolescent; adult; aged; antibiotic resistance; article; bacterial colonization; bacterial infection; bacterium isolate; case control study; clinical article; confidence interval; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; drug exposure; Escherichia coli; female; genetic identification; health care cost; hospital bed capacity; hospitalization; human; male; molecular epidemiology; multidrug resistance; multivariate analysis; plasmid; risk assessment; stroke; tertiary health care; Thailand; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; beta-Lactam Resistance; beta-Lactamases; Carrier State; Case-Control Studies; Cephalosporins; Community-Acquired Infections; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Epidemiology, Molecular; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Female; Fluoroquinolones; Humans; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Thailand",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-35548960027

One-hundred-and-twenty-six adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly assigned to receive either 1 mg of risperidone or placebo sublingually when they regained consciousness. Delirium and other outcomes were assessed. The confusion assessment method for intensive care unit was used to assess postoperative delirium. The incidence of postoperative delirium in the risperidone group was lower than the placebo group (11.1% vs. 31.7% respectively, P=0.009, relative risk=0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.16-0.77). Other postoperative outcomes were not statistically different between the groups. In exploring the factors associated with delirium, univariate analysis showed many factors were associated with postoperative delirium.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is considered to be an important cause of infection-related death and morbidity in intensive care units (ICUs). We sought to determine the long-term effect of an educational program to prevent VAP in a medical ICU (MICU). Methods. A 4-year controlled, prospective, quasi-experimental study was conducted in an MICU, surgical ICU (SICU), and coronary care unit (CCU) for 1 year before the intervention (period 1), 1 year after the intervention (period 2), and 2 follow-up years (period 3). The SICU and CCU served as control ICUs. The educational program involved respiratory therapists and nurses and included a self-study module with preintervention and postintervention assessments, lectures, fact sheets, and posters. Results. Before the intervention, there were 45 episodes of VAP (20.6 cases per 1000 ventilator-days) in the MICU, 11 (5.4 cases per 1000 ventilator-days) in the SICU, and 9 (4.4 cases per 1000 ventilator-days) in the CCU. After the intervention, the rate of VAP in the MICU decreased by 59% (to 8.5 cases per 1000 ventilator-days; P = .001) and remained stable in the SICU (5.6 cases per 1000 ventilator-days; P = .22) and CCU (4.8 cases per 1000 ventilator-days; P = .48). The rate of VAP in the MICU continued to decrease in period 3 (to 4.2 cases per 1000 ventilator-days; P = .07), and rates in the SICU and CCU remained unchanged. Compared with period 1, the mean duration of hospital stay in the MICU was reduced by 8.5 days in period 2 (P < .001) and by 8.9 days in period 3 (P < .001). The monthly hospital antibiotic costs of VAP treatment and the hospitalization cost for each patient in the MICU in periods 2 and 3 were also reduced by 45%-50% (P < .001) and 37%-45% (P < .001), respectively. Conclusions. A focused education intervention resulted in sustained reductions in the incidence of VAP, duration of hospital stay, cost of antibiotic therapy, and cost of hospitalization. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

They also have low maintenance cost because they operate without a compressor. Mainly, the ejector performance directly affects the refrigerating performance. Therefore, an investigation on the characteristics and an efficient design of the ejector are important to improve ejector refrigeration systems. In this study, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, FLUENT, is employed to predict the flow phenomena and performance of CPM and CMA steam ejectors. The ejector refrigeration system, using water as the working fluid, is operated at 120-140 °C boiler temperature and 5-15 °C evaporator temperature. CFD can predict ejector performance very well and reveal the effect of operating conditions on an effective area that is directly related to its performance. Besides, it is found that the flow pattern does not depend much on the suction zone because the results of axisymmetric and 3D simulation are similar. This investigation aids the understanding of ejector characteristics and provides information for designing the ejector to suit the optimum condition. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The treatment and control of malaria is becoming increasingly difficult due to Plasmodium falciparum resistance to commonly used antimalarials. Combination therapy is currently the strategy for combating multi-drug resistant falciparum malaria, through exploiting pharmacodynamic synergistic effects and delaying the emergence of drug resistance. The combination of artemisinin derivatives with fosmidomycin, which have different modes of action, appears to be one of the most promising combinations. The objective of the present study was to investigate the antimalarial interactions between dihydroartemisinin and fosmidomycin in vitro, against chloroquine-resistant (K1) and chloroquine-sensitive (G112) P. falciparum strains. Concentration-response analysis was performed based on an in vitro schizont maturation inhibition test. The fixed concentration ratios of dihydroartemisinin: fosmidomycin used were 0:5,000, 2:4,500, 6:3,500, 10:2,500, 14:1,500, 18:500 and 20:0 nM. The highest final concentrations of dihydroartemisinin and fosmidomycin were 20 and 5,000 nM, respectively. Results showed IC50 (drug concentration which produced 50% schizont maturation inhibition) medians (range) for dihydroartemisinin against K1 and G112 strains to be 1.6 (1.2-2.0) and 2.5 (2.4-2.6) nM, respectively.

To evaluate the efficacy of a multifaceted hospitalwide quality improvement program that featured an intervention to remind physicians to remove unnecessary urinary catheters. METHODS. A hospitalwide preintervention- postintervention study was conducted over 2 years (July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2006). The intervention consisted of nurse-generated daily reminders that were used by an intervention team to remind physicians to remove unnecessary urinary catheters, beginning 3 days after insertion. Clinical, microbiological, pharmaceutical, and cost data were collected. RESULTS. A total of 2,412 patients were enrolled in the study. No differences were found in the demographic and/or clinical characteristics of patients between the preintervention and postintervention periods. After the intervention, reductions were found in the rate of inappropriate urinary catheterization (mean rate, preintervention vs postintervention, 20.4% vs 11% [P = .04]), the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI) (mean rate, 21.5 vs 5.2 infections per 1,000 catheter-days [P < .001]), the duration of urinary catheterization (mean, 11 vs 3 days [P < .001]), and the total length of hospitalization (mean, 16 vs 5 days [P < .001]). A linear relationship was seen between the monthly average duration of catheterization and the rate of CA-UTI (r = 0.89; P < .001). The intervention had the greatest impact on the rate of CA-UTI in the intensive care units (mean rate, preintervention vs postintervention, 23.4 vs 3.5 infections per 1,000 catheter-days [P = .01]). The monthly hospital costs for antibiotics to treat CA-UTI were reduced by 63% (mean, $3,739 vs $1,378 [P < .001]), and the hospitalization cost for each patient during the intervention was reduced by 58% (mean, $366 vs $154 [P < .001]). CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that a multifaceted intervention to remind physicians to remove unnecessary urinary catheters can significantly reduced the duration of urinary catheterization and the CA-UTI rate in a hospital in a developing country. © 2007 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

To evaluate the correlation between self-report of a prior history of chickenpox and results of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G serologic test results in an outbreak of VZV infection among Thai healthcare workers (HCWs) and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of establishing routine VZV immunization as part of an occupational health program on the basis of the outbreak data. METHODS. All exposed patients received prophylaxis and the HCWs in our 3 intensive care units (ICUs) were prospectively evaluated. HCWs were assessed for disease history and serologic evidence of VZV IgG. A cost-benefit analysis was performed. RESULTS. After 140 HCWs and 18 ICU patients were exposed to VZV, 10 HCWs (7%) with active VZV infection were relieved from work until skin lesions were crusted. Acyclovir (ACV) was prescribed to all 10 HCWs with active disease, and all 18 exposed patients received prophylaxis with ACV. Of 140 HCWs, 100 consented to longitudinal follow-up. Twenty-three (100%) of the HCWs who reported a history of chickenpox also had serologic test results that were postive for VZV IgG, compared with 30 (39%) of 77 HCWs who reported no prior history of chickenpox, yet had test results that were positive for VZV IgG. Reported history of chickenpox had a sensitivity of 43%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 61% with respect to VZV infection immunity. The total cost estimate for this outbreak investigation was $23,087. CONCLUSIONS. An HCW's reported history of chickenpox was a reliable predictor of immunity; a report of no prior history of chickenpox was unreliable.

The main components consist of CMOS sensor, taper fiber optic, and image intensifier screen, CMOS sensor offers various advantages including miniaturesized, low power consumption and cost effective. CMOS-based digital camera becomes hence very demanding due to its potential application in multimedia and information technology. To apply the CMOS sensor as x-ray detector, x-ray-to-visible light convector is required. Our key component of x-ray-tovisible light converter is an image intensifier screen mounted on the wider end of taper fiber optic. The narrow end of the taper fiber optic is coupled on the half-inch CMOS image sensor. In order to get higher image quality and system flexibility, more versatile CMOS image-sensor controller are preferable. Such complicate designs are made possible by the creation of entirely VHDL reconfiguration and programmable components- the socalled Field programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The designed x-ray-detector with CMOS sensor camera has been tested to capture a bony structure and ap-plied for calcium measurement. The result is very promising. © 2006 IEEE.",Array detector; SART,Array detector; CMOS sensors; SART; Calcium; Calcium alloys; Cameras; Computer networks; Cost effectiveness; Detectors; Digital cameras; Digital image storage; Electromagnetic waves; Electron tubes; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Image intensifiers (electron tube); Image intensifiers (solid state); Image quality; Image sensors; Imaging systems; Information technology; Optical materials; Sensors; Technology; X rays; X ray optics,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50949129977

In this study, two major candidate genes, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Fc gamma receptor IIa (FcγRIIa), within these regions were investigated in Thai SLE patients. The genotyping of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (promoter area: -1082, -819 and -592) within IL-10 gene and one polymorphism (change amino acid at position 131) within FcγRIIa gene was determined in 195 SLE patients and 159 ethnically matched controls. The RR/RH genotypes of FcγRIIa were found to be significantly increased in SLE patients compared with healthy controls [OR = 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28-3.14, P = 0.001]. Interestingly, the synergistic effect between RR/RH genotypes of FcγRIIa and ACC/ACC haplotype of IL-10 in susceptibility to SLE was observed (OR = 7.84, 95% CI = 1.60-52.04, P = 0.002). In addition, the FcγRIIa, RR homozygotes was also strongly associated with anticardiolipin antibody production (OR = 6.09, 95% CI = 1.38-30.54, P = 0.006). The result demonstrated that ACC haplotype of IL-10 gene and FcγRIIa R131 polymorphism can be used as marker for genetic susceptibility and severity to SLE in Thai population, particularly individuals carrying both specific genotypes. © 2006 Blackwell Munksgaard.",Fc gamma receptor; Interleukin 10; Single-nucleotide polymorphism; Systemic lupus erythematosus,"amino acid; cardiolipin antibody; Fc receptor; fc receptor iia; interleukin 10; unclassified drug; adult; antibody producing cell; article; confidence interval; controlled study; disease severity; ethnic group; female; genetic susceptibility; genotype; haplotype; homozygosity; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; promoter region; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical significance; systemic lupus erythematosus; Thailand; Adult; Antigens, CD; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Interleukin-10; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Polymorphism, Genetic; Receptors, IgG; Risk Factors; Thailand",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750739758

The copolymer solution exhibits a thermoassociative behavior in which its elastic response dramatically increases when temperature is above the critical temperature or the association temperature, Tassoc. The copolymer at low concentration shows typical solution property. When the temperature is increased up to the critical temperature, the copolymer exhibits a gel-like characteristic due to the formation of physical cross-links between chitosan backbones through the self-aggregation of PNIPAM side chains. At high concentration, the system exhibits a weak elastic response due to the entanglement of the copolymer at 25°C. As temperature is raised above Tassoc, the system shows a strong elastic behavior due to the formation of additional physical cross-links via the aggregation of PNIPAM side chains.

The bound phages, selected from fourth round of bio-panning with each antibody, were cloned by plaque isolation and the binding specificity of individual clones were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, before being further amplified and checked for phage peptide sequence using PCR and DNA sequencing. All together 150 phages were selected, mimotope from 86 phages (56.6%) were found to match with protein sequences of Leptospira from GenBank database. The predominant mimotopes were mimotope with sequence LTPCD that found in 27.3%, followed by TPCSK (16%), KSKKSS (4%), KTKRXAS (4%), SSKSYR (3.3%), DPNXNSF (3.3%), KSGRC (2.6%), TLINIF (2%), TPCI (2%), 1.33% each with mimotopes PKKS, PCNTKXTA, and CTKKK, and one phage each (0.66%) with mimotopes PTFGS, TNSKRK, SKSSRC, RSKRIR, VTNNTP, and CSNXSKR. Interestingly, mimotopes LTPCD, TPCSK, and TPCI were found to react with both MAb and patient's sera. The matched proteins from GenBank namely, leptospiral putative outer membrane protein (matched with mimotope PTFGS), thermolysin precursor protein (matched with mimotope TPCIXXGSAS), and hypothetical protein LIC12228 (matched with mimotope CSNXSKR), were found to locate at outer membrane of Leptospira. These phage mimotopes and matched proteins may have potential for further use as diagnostic reagent and immunogen against leptospirosis in the future. The results demonstrate that phage display technique has potential for rapidly identifying phage mimotopes that interact with leptospiral MAbs and patient's sera. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a study to evaluate the impact of education and an antibiotic-control program on antibiotic-prescribing practices, antibiotic consumption, antimicrobial resistance, and cost of antibiotics in a tertiary care hospital in Thailand. Methods. A study of the year before and the year after the intervention was performed. Inpatient antibiotic prescriptions were prospectively observed. Demographic characteristics, hospital unit, indication for antibiotic prescription, appropriateness of antibiotic use, reasons for inappropriate antibiotic use, antibiotic consumption (i.e., the rate of antibiotic use), bacterial resistance, and antibiotic cost data were collected. Interventions included education, introduction of an antibiogram, use of antibiotic prescription forms, and prescribing controls. Results. After the intervention, there was a 24% reduction in the rate of antibiotic prescription (640 vs. 400 prescriptions/1000 admissions; P &lt; .001). The incidence of inappropriate antibiotic use was significantly reduced (42% vs. 20%; P &lt; .001). A sustained reduction in antibiotic use was observed (R2 = 0.692; P&lt;.001). Rates of use of third-generation cephalosporins (31 vs. 18 defined daily doses [DDDs]/1000 patient-days; P &lt; .001) and glycopeptides (3.2 vs. 2.4 DDDs/1000 patient-days; P = .002) were significantly reduced. Rates of use of cefazolin (3.5 vs. 8.2 DDDs/1000 patient-days; P &lt; .001) and fluoroquinolones (0.68 vs. 1.15 DDDs/1000 patient-days; P &lt; .001) increased. There were no significant changes for other antibiotic classes. Significant reductions in the incidence of infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (48% vs. 33.5%; P &lt; .001), extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (33% vs. 21%; P &lt; .001), extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (30% vs. 20%; P &lt; .001), and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii (27% vs. 19%; P &lt; .001) were also observed. Total costs saving were US$32,231 during the study period. Conclusions. Education and an antibiotic-control program constituted an effective and cost-saving strategy to optimize antibiotic use in a tertiary care center in Thailand. © 2006 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

All isolates carried mutant allele T76 of the pfcrt gene and wild-type allele D1246 of the pfmdr1 gene except for one isolate, which showed the wild-type K76 allele. This isolate was obtained from Chanthaburi Province, an area with high MQ resistance. Relatively low rates of the mutant alleles D1042 and Y86 of the pfmdr1 gene were found among Thai isolates of P. falciparum. However, a statistically significant difference in the distribution was noted. Most of the mutant isolates were found among isolates from areas with moderate or low MQ resistance. Only one isolate with mixed mutant and wild-type N1042 and D1042 and two mutants of Y86 were found among the isolates from areas with high MQ resistance.

The eighteen solvents used were benzene, t-butylacetate, carbontetrachloride, chlorobenzene, chloroform, cyclohexane, decahydronaphthalene (decalin), 1,2-dichloroethane, dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,4-dioxane, ethylacetate, ethylbenzene, hexane, methylethylketone (MEK), nitrobenzene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin), and toluene.

The model for the H-mode pedestal in tokamak plasmas is based on flow shear reduction of anomalous transport, while the periodic ELM crashes are triggered by MHD instabilities. The formation of the pedestal and the L-H transition in this model are the direct result of E→r × B flow shear suppression of transport. Suppression of the anomalous transport enhances the role of neoclassical transport in the pedestal region. The ratio of suppression of anomalous thermal transport in electron and ion channels controls the ratio of electron to ion temperature at the top of the pedestal. Two mechanisms for triggering ELMs are considered. ELMs are triggered by ballooning modes if the pressure gradient exceeds the ballooning limit or by peeling modes if the edge current density exceeds the peeling mode criterion. The models for the pedestal and ELMs are used in a predictive integrated modelling code to follow the time evolution of tokamak discharges from L-mode through the transition from L-mode to H-mode, with the formation of the H-mode pedestal, and, subsequently, the triggering of ELMs. The objective is to produce self-consistent predictions of the width, height and shape of the H-mode pedestal and the frequency of ELMs. The dependences of pedestal temperature, pedestal width and ELM frequency as a function of plasma heating power, magnetic field and density are discussed. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Current density; Heat transfer; Magnetic field effects; Mathematical models; Plasma heating; Turbulence; Edge localized modes (ELM); Pressure gradients; Shear suppression; Thermal transport; Tokamak devices,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-20144366023

This conclusion was supported by the finding that the full set of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) are still present in sperm chromatin, but histone H1 is replaced by its variant, H1V. Rabbit anti-sera were raised against histone H3, H1, H1V, and H5 (H1 variant in chick erythrocyte). Anti-histone H1 antiserum cross-reacted with histone H1V, which implied the presence of a common epitope. Anti-histone H1V and H5 also showed cross-reaction with each other but not with histone H1, which implied the presence of a common epitope not shared by histone H1. Immunocytochemical studies, using the above antibodies as probes, showed that histones H3 is present in all steps of spermatogenic and spermiogenic cells, and somatic cells including red blood cells, Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells, while histone H1 is present in all of the cells mentioned except in spermatozoa where it is replaced by histone H1V. Histone H1V appears in the early spermatids starting from spermatid 1 (St1), and it persists throughout the course of spermatid differentiation into spermatozoa.

Standard in vitro micro tests and in vivo efficacy according to World Health Organization methodologies were performed. P. falciparum isolates along the Thai-Myanmar border with in vitro sensitivity to mefloquine have had up to a ten-fold decrease in sensitivity compared to a baseline done in 1986, conducted one year after the drug was first introduced to Thailand. The reduction in the mefloquine sensitivity of P. falciparum isolates in Tak Province developed rapidly, with the highest IC 50 of 1,254 nM in 1997. The IC 50 declined to 1,067 and 737 nM in 1999 and 2001, respectively, but there was no statistically significant difference in the sensitivity. The sensitivity of P. falciparum isolates from Mae Hong Son, Kanchanaburi, and Ranong, where the first line treatment was mefloquine 15 mg/kg single dose, continued to decline, where in 2001 the IC 50 were 1,087, 941, and 1,116 nM, respectively, in these provinces. The difference in sensitivities of P. falciparum isolates in Mae Hong Son and Ranong in 2001, compared to 1997, was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). Good therapeutic efficacy of the artesunate-mefloquine combination in Tak Province was observed. Adequate clinical responses (ACR) were 89.5% and 92.3% in 1997 and 2002, respectively.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with nested case-control analysis. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: All patients weighing 2,000 g or less were enrolled. Data collection included risk factors for nosocomial BSI, admission severity of illness, microbiology, antimicrobial therapy, and outcomes. Inadequate empiric antimicrobial therapy was defined as the use of antibiotics for more than 48 hours after the day that blood cultures were performed that did not cover the microorganisms causing the bacteremia or administration of antibiotics that failed to cover resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-nine patients were enrolled. Forty-five developed nosocomial BSIs. The BSI rates were 11.2, 2.8, and 0 per 1,000 catheter-days for patients weighing 1,000 g or less, between 1,001 and 1,500 g, and between 1,501 and 2,000 g, respectively. After adjustment for severity of illness, the mortality in patients with nosocomial BSI receiving inadequate empiric antimicrobial therapy was higher than in those receiving adequate therapy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 1.2-23.2). By multivariate analysis, nosocomial BSI attributed to Candida species (AOR, 6.3; CI95, 1.4-28.0) and invasive procedure prior to onset of BSI (AOR, 6.4; CI95, 1.0-39.0) were associated with administration of inadequate empiric antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of inadequate empiric antimicrobial therapy among NICU patients with nosocomial BSI was associated with higher mortality. Additional studies on the role of inadequate empiric antimicrobial therapy and the outcomes of BSIs among NICU patients are needed.",,"aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; ampicillin; antibiotic agent; ceftazidime; ceftriaxone; dexamethasone; fluconazole; histamine H2 receptor antagonist; immunoglobulin; indometacin; penicillin G; surfactant; vancomycin; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; article; bacteremia; birth weight; blood culture; Candida; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease course; disease severity; drug use; female; hospital admission; hospital infection; human; infection risk; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; newborn; newborn intensive care; newborn mortality; risk factor; Anti-Infective Agents; Case-Control Studies; Cross Infection; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Logistic Models; Male; Missouri; Multivariate Analysis; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sepsis; Treatment Outcome",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-4744353773

By sorting colors based on their components along the principal axis, the one with the highest variance of color distribution, the Euclidean distances between any adjacent colors' along the axis are used to find the cutting plane that is perpendicular to the axis and divides a color cell into two subcells with approximately equal quantization errors with respect to their centroids. As a result, the total quantization error on both cells is minimal. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm is effective and yields a better execution time when compared with others. Moreover the proposed method performs well on both pictures with 15-bit and 24-bit colors regardless of a number of colors in the colormap. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It reveals that sodium diclofenac, the starting material in the preparation of a controlled-release diclofenac-containing chitosan matrix, changes to diclofenac acid in space group C2/c in the matrix. Simple methods were employed for handling the sample to obtain X-ray powder diffraction data of sufficiently high quality for the determination of the crystal structure of diclofenac embedded in chitosan. These involved grinding and sieving several times through a micro-mesh sieve to obtain a suitable particle size and a uniformly spherical particle shape. A traditional technique for structure solution from X-ray powder diffraction data was applied. The X-ray diffraction intensities were extracted using Le Bail's method. The structure was solved by direct methods from the extracted powder data and refined using the Rietveld method. For comparison, the single-crystal structure of the same drug was also determined. The result shows that the crystal structure solved from conventional X-ray powder diffraction data is in good agreement with that of the single crystal. The deviations of the differences in bond lengths and angles are of the order of 0.030 Å and 0.639°, respectively. © 2004 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.",,chitosan; diclofenac; article; comparative study; controlled drug release; crystal structure; drug formulation; drug quality; drug structure; grinding; particle size; signal noise ratio; structure analysis; X ray powder diffraction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3442893266

To determine the rates, characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in extremely preterm neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods. A prospective cohort study was conducted at the St Louis Children's Hospital on all patients who had birth weight ≤2000 g and were admitted to the NICU for ≥48 hours from October 2000 to July 2001. Extremely preterm neonates were defined as neonates with estimated gestational age (EGA) <28 weeks. The primary outcome was the development of VAP. Secondary outcomes were death and NICU length of stay (LOS). Multiple logistic regression was performed to determine independent predictors for VAP and mortality. Results. A total of 229 patients were enrolled. Sixty-seven (29%) had EGA <28 weeks. Nineteen episodes of VAP occurred in 19 (28.3%) of 67 mechanically ventilated patients. VAP rates were 6.5 per 1000 ventilator days for patients with EGA <28 weeks and 4 per 1000 ventilator days for EGA ≥28 weeks. By multivariate analysis, bloodstream infection before VAP (adjusted odds ratio: 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-10.8) was an independent risk factor for VAP after adjustment for the duration of endotracheal intubation. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.2-12.3) was an independent predictor of mortality. A strong association between VAP and mortality was observed in neonates who stayed in the NICU >30 days (relative risk: 8.0; 95% CI: 1.9-35.0). Patients with VAP also had prolonged NICU LOS (median: 138 vs 82 days). Conclusions. VAP occurred at high rates in extremely preterm neonates and was associated with increased mortality. Additional studies are needed to develop interventions to prevent VAP in NICU patients.",Characteristics; Neonatal intensive care unit; Neonates; Nosocomial infections; Outcomes; Risk factors; Ventilator-associated pneumonia,"dexamethasone; histamine H2 receptor antagonist; immunoglobulin; indometacin; lipid emulsion; surfactant; xipamide; Acinetobacter; article; artificial ventilation; birth weight; Candida; central venous catheter; coagulase negative Staphylococcus; cohort analysis; congenital heart disease; death; drug use; Enterobacter; Enterococcus; Escherichia coli; female; gestational age; hospital infection; human; Klebsiella; length of stay; major clinical study; male; newborn; newborn intensive care; patent ductus arteriosus; pneumonia; prematurity; priority journal; prospective study; Proteus; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; respiratory distress syndrome; risk factor; Staphylococcus aureus; statistical analysis; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Streptococcus agalactiae; total parenteral nutrition; ventilator; Cohort Studies; Cross Infection; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infant, Premature, Diseases; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Length of Stay; Logistic Models; Male; Pneumonia; Respiration, Artificial; Risk Factors",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346139501

Soxhlet extraction coupled with GC-14B (DB1 column) analysis was mainly employed for coke composition analysis and determination of the probability of chain growth (alpha value). It was found that the soluble coke was mainly composed of C8-C12 on both sites. Interestingly, the probabilities of chain growth on both sites were identical. However, the extracted coke on the metal site was more easily removable and had lower carbon numbers than that on the support site. Moreover, the addition of promoter, especially of K promoter, was sensitive to inhibit the probability of chain growth, resulting in the reduction of the amount of coke.",Coke; Physically Mixed Catalyst; Probability of Chain Growth; Promoter with Sn and K,Alumina; Catalysis; Catalysts; Coke; Composition; Dehydrogenation; Extraction; Infrared spectroscopy; Probability; Physically mixed catalyst; Probability of chain growth; Promoter with Sn and K; Reforming reactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0442279509

Patients and Method: Corrosive ingestion patients were studied, from July 2000 to December 2002. Reasons for ingestion, symptoms, physical findings and routine investigations were recorded in a standard form. Data analysed using the descriptive statistical method. Results: There were 73 patients, 55 women and 18 men, median age 22 years, 48 (65.8%) of whom had ingested strong acid, 3 (4.1%) ingested strong alkali. Suicidal gesture was the most common reason for ingestion (89.2%). The amount of ingestion was less in accidental cases. Symptoms of nausea/vomiting, drooling and abdominal tenderness were associated with the amount of ingestion, while severity of lips, buccal mucosa and palate injuries was significantly related with strong corrosive agents (p < 0.05). Leucocytosis was found in patients who had symptoms of drooling, hoarseness, stridor and signs of mucosal slough or superficial ulcers (p < 0.05). Four required surgery. Two of them had esophago-gastrectomy. Twenty-one patients were followed-up, with the median follow-up time of 11 (1-28) months. One patient died from HIV infection. The rest were normal.

When the ratio of the copper to tscac was reduced to 1:1, a dimeric complex [Cu2Cl2(tscac)2]2 (2) was obtained. In complex 2, two CuCl<sub/>2 species act as bridging groups between two Cu(tscac)2 moieties forming an eight-membered ring, whereas in complex 1, there is no CuCl2 moiety in the structure. In both complexes the copper(I) center is coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral geometry to two tscac groups through the sulfur and the imine nitrogen atom. In dimeric complex 2, the sulfur atom in each tscac ligand coordinates weakly to copper(I) in the CuCl2 moiety giving the distorted tetrahedral geometry.

Based on the vector-space model, the performance of this classification particularly depends on the way to weight and select important terms in documents for constructing a prototype class vector for each class. In the past, it was shown that term weighting using statistical term distributions could improve classification accuracy. However, for different data sets, the best weighting systems are different. Towards this problem, we propose a method that uses homogenous centroid-based classification. The effectiveness of this approach is explored using four data sets.

Lead exposure must be of particular concern because of ongoing exposure to thousands of workers in the industrial plants and recent research indicating that asymptomatic lead exposure can result in chronic toxicity manifestations. Therefore, determination and control lead exposure among the risk workers is very necessary. Like other developing countries, lead pollution becomes an important public health problem of Thailand, especially for the big cities as Bangkok but relatively few of these countries have introduced policies and regulations for significantly combating the problem. We set this pilot study to determine the blood lead levels by anodic stripping volammetry (ASV) method as a marker for lead exposure among the occupational exposed and control subjects. Totally 89 subjects, 20 control subjects and 69 garage workers (52 mechanics and 17 dye sprayers), as the representatives of occupational exposed subjects, were included into this preliminary study. The mean blood lead level in the control group was 0.32 ± 0.07 μmol/l. The mean blood lead level in the mechanics group was 0.42 ± 0.13 μmol/l. The mean blood lead level in the dye sprayers was 0.58 ± 0.07 μmol/l. Significant higher blood lead levels among the mechanics and dye sprayer groups were observed (P < 0.05). Based on this study, the considerations for prevention of possibly exposure to lead among the high-risk workers as public health policies was recommended.",Dye sprayers; Lead; Mechanics,"dye; lead; anodic stripping potentiometry; article; blood level; chronic toxicity; controlled study; developing country; health hazard; human; industry; intoxication; lead blood level; lead poisoning; major clinical study; male; occupational health; pilot study; policy; public health; Thailand; worker; air pollutant; blood; occupational exposure; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Humans; Lead; Male; Occupational Exposure; Thailand",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036887964

Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine - in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days - and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days.

Dark lip is a common cosmetic problem in Southeast Asia. There is no known effective treatment. OBJECTIVE. To propose an effective method for treating dark lips of varying causes with frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd: YAG laser. METHODS. Seventy patients with dark lip, of which 22 were congenital, 24 acquired, and 24 of uncertain cause, were treated by frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at a fluence of 2-3.5 J/cm2 (mode 2.5 J/cm2) after application of topical anesthesia. The endpoint of treatment was complete clearance of the pigment. Follow-up time was 24-36 months (mean 29 months). RESULTS. All patients attained complete clearance of the lesion after an average of 2.5 treatments in the congenital group, 2.2 treatments in the acquired group, and 1.8 treatments in the group with uncertain etiology. The mean (±SD) number of treatments required by the whole group was 2.1 ± 1.4. Recurrence was observed in one case of congenital origin 3 months after the last treatment. In the remaining cases, results persisted up to the time of follow-up. Herpes simplex reactivation was noted in one case 3 days after treatment. There was no dyschromia, scar formation, or change of skin texture. CONCLUSION. Dark lip can be effectively treated by frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser without major adverse effects.",,cosmetic; adolescent; adult; article; female; Herpes simplex virus; human; lentigo; lip disease; major clinical study; male; melanocyte; neodymium laser; pigmentation; priority journal; prophylaxis; scar formation; tattooing; virus reactivation; Adolescent; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Hyperpigmentation; Lasers; Lip Diseases; Male,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035139952

All of them were receiving weight-maintaining diets composed of 12 per cent protein, 30 per cent fat and 58 per cent carbohydrate. The only difference among all study-diets was the types of complex carbohydrate used. High-glycemic diet (HG) or low glycemic diet (LG) consisted mainly of glutinous rice or mungbean noodles and the intermediate-glycemic diet (DM) was solely white rice. After the metabolic evaluation of the baseline diet (BL), each subject was placed on DM and followed randomly by HG and LG or vice versa for 4 weeks each. The diurnal plasma glucose levels tended to be lowest after LG. The integrated plasma glucose levels among all diets were not different. The integrated insulin levels after DM and LG did not differ but they were lower than HG and BL. Long-term ingestion of all test-diets spilt less urinary glucose than BL, the lowest was LG. HbA1 levels and nitrogen balance after all diets were better than BL, the best was LG. It was concluded that in addition to strict dietary control, ingestion of mungbean noodles (a low glycemic diet) without increasing fiber intake, can improve diabetic control and protein conservation in type 2 diabetes.",Asian food; Diabetic diet; Glutinous rice; Glycemic index; Glycemic indices; Mungbean noodles; Rice; Sticky rice,"adult; anthropometry; article; clinical trial; comparative study; diabetic diet; diet therapy; energy metabolism; female; glucose blood level; human; long term care; metabolism; methodology; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonparametric test; protein intake; protein restriction; Thailand; traditional medicine; treatment outcome; Adult; Anthropometry; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Diet; Diet, Protein-Restricted; Dietary Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Long-Term Care; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Statistics, Nonparametric; Thailand; Treatment Outcome",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035234825

Before 1920, 1.4 and 6.5 per cent of all adenoids and tonsils removed from asymptomatic patients were infected by tuberculosis. After the introduction of antituberculous chemotherapy and BCG vaccination, this disease was considered uncommon and sporadic cases were reported in the medical literature. Recently, tuberculosis has begun to increase again due to the high global HIV-infected rate and antituberculous drug resistance among these people. To describe and highlight the clinical features of this condition, fifteen Thai patients (7 males and 8 females) from the Department of Otolaryngology, Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were reviewed. Cervical lymphadenopathy was the most common presenting symptom in our series (93.34%), 11 of them were classified as primary nasopharyngeal tuberculosis and most had abnormal nasopharyngeal findings by mirror examination except 2 cases. Although all had histopathological confirmation of nasopharyngeal tuberculosis, sometimes problems occur in the diagnosis between this disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which are also common among Oriental people in many of their clinical similarities. Therefore routine nasopharyngeal biopsy is considered justified and diagnostic.",,"tuberculostatic agent; adolescent; adult; aged; article; child; differential diagnosis; female; follow up; human; male; middle aged; nasopharynx tumor; needle biopsy; pathology; pharynx disease; prognosis; Thailand; tuberculosis; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antitubercular Agents; Biopsy, Needle; Child; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nasopharyngeal Diseases; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Prognosis; Thailand; Tuberculosis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032059090

They answered open‐ended questions about what police officers or nurses do (in real life or on TV) and rated the typicality of various job activities. Their schematic knowledge about TV and real occupations was clearly differentiated. TV versions entailed more glamour, higher income, more stereotypes, and more dramatic events without negative consequences. Real‐life occupations entailed more effort, status, and excitement. Older children differentiated slightly more clearly than younger ones. Children who perceived television as factual and realistic had real‐world schemata similar to TV images. Children who were heavy viewers and perceived television as realistic were most likely to aspire to jobs shown on TV. Conclusion: children form separate schemata for social information acquired from TV and from real‐world experience, but those who perceive television as socially realistic are apt to incorporate TV messages in their schemata and their aspirations.
